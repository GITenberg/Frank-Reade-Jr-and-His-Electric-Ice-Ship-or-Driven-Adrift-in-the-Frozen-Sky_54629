</div>

<p class='c012'>It was late on a cold November night in the city of Boston,
the sky was obscured by dark, stormy clouds, a bleak
wind was whistling through the almost deserted streets,
and the lights in the lamps flickered dimly.</p>

<p class='c000'>A plainly attired man with white hair and a black mustache
was walking away from the railroad depot with a
handsome boy of seventeen, clad in the natty blue uniform
of a military academy.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Alfred Milburn,” the boy was saying pleadingly, “do
not keep me in suspense any longer. Tell me why you wrote
me to come to Boston to-night from my school. What serious
news have you to tell me?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“You must prepare yourself for a great affliction, Walter
Grey,” the man replied. “I hate to break bad news,
but——”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Great heavens!” exclaimed young Grey, suddenly—“my
mother——”</p>

<p class='c000'>“She suddenly became insane, and I have had to place
her in a private asylum,” said Alfred Milburn, in low, gentle
tones.</p>

<p class='c000'>A stifled cry of woe escaped the boy, and he burst into
tears, for his mother was the only relative he had in the
world.</p>

<p class='c000'>He paused and glanced piteously at the lawyer, who had
been acting as administrator of the fortune his father had
left, and saw that Milburn was very pale and greatly agitated.</p>

<p class='c000'>As soon as Walter could master his grief, he asked, tremulously:</p>

<p class='c000'>“When did this horrible misfortune occur, sir?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Just a week ago, my boy. I am very sorry for you.
Brace up! She may recover her reason. I will take you to
see her to-night.”</p>

<p class='c000'>There was a spark of hope in what the lawyer said, and
Walter eagerly grasped at it, and answered:</p>

<p class='c000'>“I can never get over this shock; but I shall try to be
courageous, Mr. Milburn. Take me to her. Let me see
my dear mother. Perhaps I can do something for her.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Very well,” replied the lawyer. “Come this way.”</p>

<p class='c000'>He turned into a street bordering the water front, and
casting a rapid glance around, failed to see any one except
three men, attired in the garb of sailors, crouching in an
adjoining doorway.</p>

<p class='c000'>The lawyer drew his handkerchief from his pocket, wiped
his face with it, and while apparently returning it to his
pocket, dropped it. Instantly the three sailors darted from
the doorway.</p>

<p class='c000'>One of them, in a captain’s uniform, darted up behind the
boy, flung an arm around his neck, pulled his head back,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2'>2</span>and clapped a sponge saturated with chloroform to Walter
Grey’s nostrils.</p>

<p class='c000'>A cry of alarm pealed from the startled boy’s lips, but
it was quickly checked by a pressure of his assailant’s arm,
and the moment he began to inhale the fumes of the drug
he became stupefied.</p>

<p class='c000'>Milburn recoiled a few steps.</p>

<p class='c000'>His dark eyes were flashing with excitement.</p>

<p class='c000'>He cautiously glanced around, and then saw a young man
coming.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Captain Ben Bolt!” he hissed.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Well?” gruffly asked the man who held young Grey.</p>

<p class='c000'>“There’s some one coming.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Blast it! But the boy’s senseless!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“The fellow is running toward us.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“He’s seen ther struggle, then.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yes. What shall we do?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Carry ther lad aboard the Red Eric.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“And you?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“We’ll lay that lubber out!”</p>

<p class='c000'>The lawyer picked the drugged boy up and hastened over
the muddy street with him toward a big whaling ship lying
at one of the docks.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the meantime the three sailors surrounded the newcomer.</p>

<p class='c000'>He proved to be a dashing-looking young man, with a
dark mustache, a symmetrical and athletic figure, and an
intellectual face.</p>

<p class='c000'>He had been behind the lawyer and the boy when they
left the depot, and seeing the assault and Milburn’s indifference,
he correctly concluded that the boy had been led
into a trap.</p>

<p class='c000'>“You scoundrels!” he panted: “what are you doing to
that boy?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Keep away thar!” roared the captain, threateningly.
“Mind yer own business and clear out of this.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Never, until that boy is released!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Go fer ther meddler, my lads!”</p>

<p class='c000'>As the three seamen closed in on him, the stranger doubled
up his fist and struck out straight from the shoulder.</p>

<p class='c000'>Biff! Bang! Thump! went his fists like pile drivers,
and every time they struck a man went down.</p>

<p class='c000'>“When people of your stamp fool around Frank Reade,
Jr., you generally get left!” muttered the gallant stranger.</p>

<p class='c000'>The sailors swore as they got up, and the captain drew a
pistol.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Cuss yer!” he growled, as he leveled the weapon at
Frank’s head. “I’ll blow yer brains out fer them welts!”</p>

<p class='c000'>Bang! went the pistol, and a cry escaped Frank.</p>

<p class='c000'>He clapped his hand to the side of his head where the
ball had grazed his scalp, and reeling back, fell senseless to
the ground.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Run, boys!” hoarsely cried the desperate captain. “I
had ter do it or he’d got ther best of us! That shot’ll fetch
ther p’lice!”</p>

<p class='c000'>They rushed over to the whaling ship unseen, leaving
their victim lying bleeding and senseless on the sidewalk.</p>

<p class='c000'>Boarding the vessel and going into the cabin they found
the lawyer there in the gloom with the drugged boy.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Well?” eagerly asked Milburn. “Did you down the
stranger?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Shot him!” answered Ben Bolt, with an oath. “I see
yer got ther lad aboard all right.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yes; you had better put him out of sight.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Stow him below in a locker, boys,” said the captain to
his two men.</p>

<p class='c000'>They carried the limp form of Walter Grey out of the
cabin.</p>

<p class='c000'>When they were gone, Milburn handed the captain a big
roll of bills.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Here are the $2,500 I promised you to shanghai the
boy,” said the lawyer. “You must maroon him in the arctic
regions, so he can never return. If you should bring me
evidence of his death I will double the amount I just gave
you. Will you do it, captain?”</p>

<p class='c000'>He bent nearer to Bolt, and hissed this in such
sinister tones that the captain started, and muttered
hoarsely:</p>

<p class='c000'>“Do yer mean fer me ter put him out of ther way?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yes,” was the emphatic reply.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Why dyer want this done?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I’ll make a clean breast of the matter. I hold some
money in trust belonging to the boy and his mother. If
both die I can do as I like with their fortune. Although
the woman is sane, I have paid dearly to have her confined
in an asylum. She is disposed of. Now it only remains
to get rid of the boy. This I leave to you.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I’ll do it!” muttered the captain.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Remember, the money I paid you is some of the boy’s
fortune. The remainder you are to get will come from the
same source. If you fail, you will get no more of the bank
notes, and may not only have to disgorge what you now
have, but also answer in court as my accomplice.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Trust me, Alfred Milburn.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I’ll go now.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“An’ as I’ve cleared my manifest in ther Custom House,
an’ thar’s a tug waitin’ ter haul us out, I’ll put to sea right
away, so’s no one will have a show ter git aboard an’ find
ther lad.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“You are bound for the Polar regions now?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Ay, ay—ther Kara Sea, off Nova Zembla, in s’arch o’
whales.”</p>

<p class='c000'>After some further conversation the rascally lawyer
parted with the villainous captain and went ashore.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Red Eric put to sea immediately afterward, carrying
the unfortunate Walter Grey away to the frozen polar
regions.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the meantime a crowd had been attracted by the pistol
shot, and surrounding Frank Reade, Jr., they carried him
into a drug store, where his wound was dressed.</p>

<p class='c000'>He did not recover his senses until after the ship departed,
and then found a policeman standing beside him, to
whom he explained what had happened.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_3'>3</span>“My name is Frank Reade, Jr.,” said the wounded young
man. “I am an inventor of submarine boats, flying machines
and overland engines, and reside in Readestown. I
have just invented a flying ice boat, and came to Boston to
get some things for her construction. While I was passing
the railroad depot on my way to the hotel where I am
stopping, I saw a man and boy go by in the same direction
I was taking. Then I observed how he was led into the
trap.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“What ship did they take him on?” asked the policeman.</p>

<p class='c000'>“The Red Eric.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Come and show me.”</p>

<p class='c000'>They left the drug store, and reaching the dock, learned
from some longshoremen that the whaler had just departed
for the Arctic.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was a bitter disappointment, as they could not now
hope to rescue the boy from his captors.</p>

<p class='c000'>Seeing that he could do nothing further in the matter,
Frank took his departure and proceeded back to the hotel.</p>

<p class='c000'>As he entered the office he observed a woman standing
before the clerk weeping bitterly, and heard her say in sob-choked
tones:</p>

<p class='c000'>“Do not refuse me lodging here, sir! You surely would
not have me roam the streets all night for want of shelter.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Madam,” replied the clerk, “as you have no money to
pay for your lodging here, I have no right to take you in.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Oh, this is dreadful,” said the lady in tones of great distress.</p>

<p class='c000'>She was a very refined-looking person, with gray hair, a
good face, and wore a very handsome dress, but she had on
no hat.</p>

<p class='c000'>The clerk shrugged his shoulders and turned away.</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank was moved with pity for the lady.</p>

<p class='c000'>He saw that she was no professional beggar.</p>

<p class='c000'>Approaching her and doffing his hat, he said politely:</p>

<p class='c000'>“Excuse me for interfering, madam, but I could not fail
hearing what you said. If you will allow me, I would be
very glad to pay your expenses at this hotel for a week.”</p>

<p class='c000'>A cry of joy escaped the woman as she glanced at Frank.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Thank Heaven!” she muttered. “I am safe—safe!”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='II' class='c009'>CHAPTER II.<br /> <span class='large'>THE VILLAIN CAUGHT.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c012'>The hotel clerk looked very much surprised at Frank’s
charitable deed, but took his money, made no comment,
and assigned the lady to a room.</p>

<p class='c000'>As she reached the parlor door, she beckoned to the inventor
and he followed her into the room and asked her
pleasantly:</p>

<p class='c000'>“Do you wish to speak to me, madam?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I wish to thank you for your kindness,” she faltered.</p>

<p class='c000'>“It is not necessary,” replied Frank.</p>

<p class='c000'>“At least let me tell you how I happened to be in this
plight.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I admit that I am somewhat curious about it.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Well, briefly, I am a rich widow with one child—a boy
of seventeen, who is now at a military boarding school up
the State. My fortune was placed under the administration
of an unscrupulous lawyer named Alfred Milburn. He
calculated that if I and my son were out of the way, he
could keep possession of our money. My name is Caroline
Grey. I lived in a handsome dwelling on a good street, and
my lawyer boarded with me.</p>

<p class='c000'>“One week ago the wretch drugged me. When I recovered
my senses I found myself confined in a private lunatic
asylum. Milburn called and coolly told me he did it to
rob me. He also stated that he intended to send for my son
and have him carried away to sea, from whence he would
never return. Frantic with apprehension, I managed to escape
from the asylum to-night. That is why I have no bonnet
on. Coming here, I tried to secure shelter until tomorrow,
when I intend to state my case to the police. I
will have Milburn arrested and baffle his design.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Is he a tall man with white hair and a jet black mustache?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yes—do you know him—have you seen him?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I saw him to-night. And your son—is he a well-formed
boy with a military uniform of dark blue, trimmed with
light blue braid?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yes—yes!” excitedly cried the lady. “Walter has very
fair skin and jet black eyes. There is a small scar on his
left cheek.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I was not near enough to distinguish his features
well.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Near enough? You couple his description with that of
Milburn—is it possible you have seen them together?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yes—to-night. The boy was abducted.”</p>

<p class='c000'>A low cry of horror escaped Mrs. Grey, her face turned
deathly pale, and a wild look sprang to her eyes as she
gasped:</p>

<p class='c000'>“What has happened? Tell me quick!”</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank detailed his adventure.</p>

<p class='c000'>Mrs. Grey was overwhelmed with grief and despair.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Bound for the Arctic Ocean!” she groaned. “Oh, he
will never come back alive! My poor, poor boy! This is
dreadful—dreadful! Oh, what shall I do? I am wild—frantic—filled
with agony!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Hush!” said Frank, gently. “I alone can give you
hope.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I do not understand you.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Then I will explain. I am Frank Reade, Jr.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“What! The wonderful inventor of whom I have so
often read!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I am an inventor, and my latest contrivance is a flying
ice boat, with which I have planned to visit the mysterious
land of Nova Zembla. As my course will be the same as
that of the ship Red Eric it is more than likely that I shall
fall in with that whaling ship. If I don’t I’ll hunt for it.
If I find her I shall save your son. I swear it, for I have
the means of doing so.”</p>

<p class='c000'>His words were so emphatic that renewed hope was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_4'>4</span>aroused in the heart of the half-distracted mother, and she
dried her tears and asked:</p>

<p class='c000'>“When do you intend to undertake this journey, sir?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Within a few days,” Frank replied. “My flying ice
ship is nearly finished. I came to Boston to get the few
things I need to complete her. To-morrow I am going
home; but ere I leave this city I shall make it my business
to help you to have Alfred Milburn arrested, so you can
recover possession of the fortune of which he designs to rob
you.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“God bless you, Frank Reade,” the lady exclaimed,
feelingly.</p>

<p class='c000'>After some further talk they parted for the night.</p>

<p class='c000'>The inventor was accompanied by a little old negro named
Pomp, and a rollicking, red-headed, pug-nosed Irishman
named Barney O’Shea, who always went with him on his
travels, and lived in Readestown.</p>

<p class='c000'>Both were inveterate practical jokers; the coon was a good
cook and played the banjo, and the Celt was an expert violinist,
and ever ready for a fight or fun of any kind, while
both were greatly devoted to the inventor.</p>

<p class='c000'>They were domiciled in the hotel with Frank.</p>

<p class='c000'>On the following morning the coon woke up early, dressed
himself, and going out into the hall heard Barney snoring
in his room.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Golly! wha’ lazy feller dat I’ishman am,” muttered the
darky, with a grin, as he paused outside of Barney’s room.
“Specs he sleep de whole lib long day ef I done let him.
Wondah if I kin git in dar?”</p>

<p class='c000'>He tried the door, found it unlocked, and entered the bedroom.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Celt lay on his back, with his month wide open,
and Pomp stole over to the wash-basin, turned on the freezing
cold water full force, put his finger over the faucet, and
squirted it at the sleeper.</p>

<p class='c000'>Swish—plunk! went the jet against the Irishman’s eye.</p>

<p class='c000'>Then a steady stream flew all over his face.</p>

<p class='c000'>He gave a sudden start, the snoring ceased, and he sat
up very much confused from being awakened so violently.</p>

<p class='c000'>The cold water continued to squirt on him, and he gave
a wild yell.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Murdher! I’m dhrowndin’!” he howled.</p>

<p class='c000'>Then he bounced out of bed.</p>

<p class='c000'>Fizz—swish—flipp! continued the stream.</p>

<p class='c000'>Barney only wore a red flannel undershirt, and as the
cold liquid flew about his limbs he jumped up in the air,
his teeth chattering, his hair on end, and roar after roar
pealing from his lips.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Begorra! I’m a dead man!” he roared, as he rushed,
danced, hopped and galloped around the room, followed
by the cold stream and the laughter of the mischievous
coon. “Howly beans! ther roofs leakin’! Ther poipes
bushted! Ther house is afoire! Help! Help!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yah! yah! yah!” howled the delighted darky. “Haw,
haw, haw! Lord amassy, looker de jumpin’-jack!”</p>

<p class='c000'>And s-s-s-s-sphf! Piff-piff-piff! went the water again.</p>

<p class='c000'>By this time Barney got over his confusion and saw the
coon.</p>

<p class='c000'>He also observed the cause of his misery.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Faith, it’s ther naygur!” he groaned, as he tried to
dodge the stream.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Whoop her up! Dat’s de step, honey! Oh, Lawd—looker
dem legs fly!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Shtop it!” shouted the Celt, as he raced around to
avoid the freezing water. “Bedad, I’m frozen! Pomp, ye
spalpeen, wanst I get ther grip av me fingers in ther wool
av yer head, I’ll scalp yez wid wan pull.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Hop, dar, yo’ chimpanzee; hop, I say! I’se gwine to
gib yo’ a wash if yo’ neber hab one befo’, chile.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Barney flew into a closet.</p>

<p class='c000'>Here the door protected him.</p>

<p class='c000'>There were several pairs of shoes, a boot jack, and sundry
other objects lying upon the floor, which he eagerly
grasped.</p>

<p class='c000'>The next moment he bombarded the coon with them
from behind the door, and as the fusillade whizzed through
the air, Pomp made an effort to dodge them.</p>

<p class='c000'>He was not quick enough, and the next moment a shoe
caught him a thump on the nose, a valise banged him on
the ear, and a whisk broom pounded him in the eye.</p>

<p class='c000'>With a howl of pain, as a second volley struck him, he
charged on the Irishman, who had come from behind the
door.</p>

<p class='c000'>The coon’s head was down to butt the Irishman in the
stomach, but just at the right moment Barney nimbly
sprang aside, and with a terrible crash Pomp’s head struck
a panel of the door.</p>

<p class='c000'>It went through, splintering the wood, and before he
could withdraw his skull, Barney seized one of the bed-slats
and belabored him so that every thump sounded like a
pistol shot, and the howls of the captured coon awakened
every one in the house.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the midst of the furore Frank rushed in, and although
he could hardly refrain from laughing at the drenched
Irishman and the stuck darky, he assumed an angry look
and cried, sternly:</p>

<p class='c000'>“Stop that row, will you? Every one in the hotel is
alarmed.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Masther Frank,” muttered Barney, dropping the slat.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Pull me out!” shouted Pomp. “I’se stuck!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Faix, I’ll lave yer till yer cocoanut dhrops off!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Oh, Lawd amighty, I’se got——”</p>

<p class='c000'>He gave his head a jerk and extricated himself.</p>

<p class='c000'>The moment he got free and saw Frank he wilted, and
making a dive for the door, vanished in the hall.</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank and the other guests burst into a roar of laughter
and followed him.</p>

<p class='c000'>When the coon and the Irishman met at the breakfast
table, they had so far forgotten their anger that the subject
was not referred to.</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank afterward took them aside, told them all about
Mrs. Grey and her son, and after introducing them to the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_5'>5</span>lady they went to police headquarters and laid the matter
before the authorities.</p>

<p class='c000'>A detective took a warrant for the arrest of Alfred Milburn,
and accompanying Mrs. Grey to her residence with
Frank and his friends, they went in and arrested the lawyer.</p>

<p class='c000'>His dismay was intense when he saw Mrs. Grey free and
Frank in her company, for he recognized the young inventor
at once.</p>

<p class='c000'>The rascal was locked up.</p>

<p class='c000'>We may as well add here that he had to disgorge the
money he held in trust for the widow and her son, and
without much delay was sentenced to a long term in prison
for his rascality.</p>

<p class='c000'>The widow received her rights.</p>

<p class='c000'>Having procured the parts of the flying machine they
were after, Frank and his two friends assured the lady again
that they would strain every effort to rescue her son, and
then boarded a train for home.</p>

<p class='c000'>Readestown, to where they went, was a beautiful little
western city near a river that flowed to the Atlantic.</p>

<p class='c000'>Here dwelt Frank in a magnificent mansion, near which
stood the great machine shops in which his wonderful inventions
were constructed.</p>

<p class='c000'>The young inventor upon his arrival found an old friend
there named Dr. Vaneyke, who had often gone with him on
his trips.</p>

<p class='c000'>The white-bearded old scientist had heard that Frank had
built a new flying machine, and being desirous of accompanying
him in it on his proposed journey, had come from the
Smithsonian Institute, with which he was connected, to
join the inventor.</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank was delighted at the prospect of having his old
friend go, and readily assented to the plan.</p>

<p class='c000'>On the following day, as the air ship was nearly finished,
the inventor brought the professor out to the shop to see it.</p>

<p class='c000'>Here a singular and unexpected incident occurred.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='III' class='c009'>CHAPTER III.<br /> <span class='large'>BAFFLED.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c012'>The room in which Frank’s invention stood was a vast
apartment, with sliding doors in the roof which could be
operated to permit the exit of his flying machines from the
interior.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the middle of this room stood the flying ice ship.</p>

<p class='c000'>The vessel was made of an extremely light, bullet-proof
material called aluminum, and looked like a two-masted
schooner, with a rounded, wedge-shaped bow and stern.</p>

<p class='c000'>At the truck of each mast was a large gyroscope, while
upon the upper part of each of the yards many more of
these wheels were arranged in a horizontal position to lift
the engine in the air.</p>

<p class='c000'>Upon the yards and stays were furled sails, to be used
while traveling before the wind.</p>

<p class='c000'>At the bow was a long bowsprit, a searchlight at its foot,
and upon its deck, in the forward section, a pilot-house.</p>

<p class='c000'>There were three big steel ice runners on each side, and
between them two spiked wheels for propelling the boat
over the ice without sails.</p>

<p class='c000'>At the stern was an ice rudder, above it a water rudder,
a water screw, and on the end of a shaft an immense air-wheel
for propulsion.</p>

<p class='c000'>Bull’s-eyes broke the sides of the hull to admit light into
the interior.</p>

<p class='c000'>As they stood looking at the boat, which was operated by
electricity, the door-bell rang, and Frank saw the professor
start nervously, turn very pale, and glare at the entrance.</p>

<p class='c000'>“What’s the matter? You look nervous!” said Frank.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I am nervous,” admitted Vaneyke. “So would any one
be who is innocent of murder, and is accused of killing a
man.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Why, I don’t understand you.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Then I’ll explain,” said the doctor. “But until I do, I
don’t want you to open that door, for I have a feeling that
the police are there, trying to get in to arrest me!”</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank was amazed.</p>

<p class='c000'>He knew that Dr. Vaneyke was a good man.</p>

<p class='c000'>Murder was the last crime he was capable of committing.</p>

<p class='c000'>He therefore said quietly:</p>

<p class='c000'>“Tell me what your trouble is, professor.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Night before last, while walking here from the railroad
depot, I heard a pistol shot in a lonely part of the road,
followed by the cry of murder,” the doctor answered.
“Running forward, I saw a man fall to the ground, and another
man plunged into the bushes. Beside the fallen man
laid a revolver which I picked up. It was the weapon with
which the man was shot; I next examined the body. The
man was dead. The ball had penetrated his heart. Scarcely
had I made this discovery when some constables came
running up the road and some men down the road.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Among the latter was the murderer. I recognized him
at a glance. He pointed at me and said: “Arrest him; he
killed the man; I saw him do it. See, he yet holds the pistol
in his hand with which the crime was committed!” Although
I protested my innocence, no one believed me. The
men surrounded me; they were going to forcibly arrest me.
Seeing how strong the circumstantial evidence was against
me, I fled and escaped in safety to your house unseen. Since
then, I am sure the authorities have been searching for me.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“It looks black against you, Dr. Vaneyke.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Shall I surrender myself and stand trial?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“You may not establish your innocence if you do.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Then what shall I do?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Keep shady; if arrested you can’t go with me.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Very true.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I want to leave as soon as possible in pursuit of the Red
Eric to rescue Walter Grey. I can’t do it if you are arrested
with such a serious charge hanging over your head. No!
You must not submit to arrest.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Bang, bang! came the sound of a volley of raps at the
door.</p>

<p class='c000'>“They’re bound to get in,” nervously said Dr. Vaneyke.</p>

<p class='c000'>“After all, it may not be any one after you.”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>“No one knew I came here.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“For safety get aboard the ice ship and hide yourself,
while I open the door and ascertain who is outside.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The professor complied.</p>

<p class='c000'>He had hardly done so when the bell rang loudly.</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank flung open the door.</p>

<p class='c000'>Upon the threshold stood a detective.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Well?” demanded Frank, eyeing him keenly.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I am after Dr. Vaneyke, sir,” replied the officer.</p>

<p class='c000'>“What for?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Murder.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Humbug!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Here’s the warrant.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“You are on the wrong track.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Oh, no! It’s proven! He’s here, isn’t he?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Stopping at my house—yes.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Your wife just said he came out here.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Well, you can’t have him, sir.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Do you mean to say you will prevent me?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Exactly so. He is an innocent man.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Let him prove it in court, then.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“At present he has no time to do that.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“But I must take him, Mr. Reade.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Have you a search warrant?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“No,” reluctantly said the detective.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Then you can’t come in here.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I’ll watch for him outside, then.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Very well,” answered Frank, shutting the door.</p>

<p class='c000'>He went aboard of the Ranger, as he had christened the
flying ice ship, and opening a door in the wheel-house, found
himself in a large room.</p>

<p class='c000'>It contained some furniture, a compass, steering wheel,
levers for controlling the mechanism, and a number of registers.</p>

<p class='c000'>A companionway led him down into a small but beautiful
cabin, where he found the professor pacing nervously to
and fro.</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank told him what had transpired.</p>

<p class='c000'>“It’s just as I feared,” murmured Dr. Vaneyke, despairingly.
“The detective will guard this place until he can
get a warrant to come in after me. Then he will take me
anyway.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Not if I can prevent it,” replied Frank.</p>

<p class='c000'>“You cannot do anything.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Oh, yes, I can. A little more work will put the Ranger
in perfect order. She is already equipped for her intended
journey, and contains enough food and water to last several
months. By to-night we will all leave here in her.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Dr. Vaneyke looked more hopeful.</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank then left him, and going to the house, explained
the situation to his family, Barney and Pomp.</p>

<p class='c000'>A plan was then formed to get the detective out of the
way.</p>

<p class='c000'>The coon went out, and purchasing a white beard and
wig from a costumer, he returned to the house, and one of
Frank’s mechanics was dressed up in the professor’s clothes,
and donned the false hair.</p>

<p class='c000'>A saddle horse was led from the stable, the man looking
very much like Vaneyke mounted the beast and away he
rode.</p>

<p class='c000'>The detective saw him, and pursued him at once, thinking
he was chasing the old scientist.</p>

<p class='c000'>Our friends then set to work upon the air ship, and completed
the work to be done upon her.</p>

<p class='c000'>Dr. Vaneyke’s trunk was carried aboard.</p>

<p class='c000'>Nothing was seen of the detective all day.</p>

<p class='c000'>By the hour of eleven that night the ice ship was almost
ready.</p>

<p class='c000'>The four friends were aboard, working by electric light
with all the speed they could muster, and had taken leave
of every one.</p>

<p class='c000'>Scarcely had everything been put in readiness when there
came a tremendous pounding at the door again.</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank rushed out on deck.</p>

<p class='c000'>Addressing a gang of his men, he cried:</p>

<p class='c000'>“Open the sliding doors in the roof, boys.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Some one is knocking, sir,” ventured one of the men.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Don’t open the door on your lives!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“All right, sir.”</p>

<p class='c000'>And away went the men to obey his orders.</p>

<p class='c000'>The clamor outside now became furious.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Frank Reade, Jr.!” yelled the detective’s voice. “Open
this door in the name of the law or I’ll break it down!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“He has discovered our ruse and come back!” laughed
Frank.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Do you hear me?” roared the officer, showering a volley
of kicks and blows against the door. “You are breaking
the law by harboring a criminal, sir, and it will go hard
with you if you still refuse to let me take him out of there.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Go away,” replied Frank. “You can’t enter.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Don’t be rash. I have several officers with me.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I don’t care if you have an army.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Then I’ll burst in the door!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Burst away.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Crash—bang—boom! came a shower of heavy blows.</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank glanced at his workmen, and saw them trying to
force open the sliding doors in the roof above the Ranger.</p>

<p class='c000'>They obstinately stuck fast, though.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>Fast and furious fell the blows against the door outside.</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank began to get restless, and passing into the wheel-room,
he peered out the window with an anxious look upon
his face.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was evident that the officers had brought a battering
ram to bear upon the door, for every blow they dealt it made
it shake, and caused every window pane to rattle.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Lively, there, boys! Lively!” shouted Frank, impatiently.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yes, sir, but they stick,” replied the foreman.</p>

<p class='c000'>An awful shower of blows now struck the door, and it
went down with a splitting crash, and the detective and
several policemen rushed in.</p>

<p class='c000'>Just then the doors in the roof flew open.</p>

<p class='c000'>Seeing the professor aboard the air ship, the officers made
a rush for the Ranger to board her.</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank grasped one of the levers and pulled it.</p>

<p class='c000'>The gyroscopes flew around with a tremendous buzzing
sound, and just as the officers reached the side of the boat
she ascended into the air.</p>

<p class='c000'>A yell of chagrin escaped the officers, for the Ranger shot
through the now open roof and soared up into the dark sky.</p>

<p class='c000'>They were baffled.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='IV' class='c009'>CHAPTER IV.<br /> <span class='large'>NOVA ZEMBLA.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c012'>“Escaped them, by thunder!” cried Frank, exultantly.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Thank Heaven for that!” exclaimed Dr. Vaneyke.</p>

<p class='c000'>Barney and Pomp had gone down below to attend to the
machinery.</p>

<p class='c000'>The rooms were magnificently furnished, and consisted
of a cabin, a dormitory, dining-room, kitchen, storeroom
and engine-room.</p>

<p class='c000'>Each apartment was equipped with electric lights and an
electric heating apparatus of Frank’s invention.</p>

<p class='c000'>The motive power was derived from a dynamo which was
driven by a small petroleum engine; there was a special
machine for the electric lights, and the mechanism of the
gyroscopes worked by a large number of storage batteries.</p>

<p class='c000'>Any height could be reached in the air, according to the
speed at which the gyroscopes were run, and the huge driving
wheel drove the ice ship along at a prodigious rate of
speed.</p>

<p class='c000'>Upon reaching an altitude of 1,600 feet, Frank slackened
the speed of the gyroscopes to conform to the height at
which he desired to remain, and put the driving screw in
motion.</p>

<p class='c000'>The machine was then steered for the northeastward, and
glided through the air like an arrow.</p>

<p class='c000'>The machinery worked exactly as Frank had designed,
and the ship of the air operated beautifully.</p>

<p class='c000'>Barney and Pomp were so delighted over the professor’s
escape that the former got out his fiddle and the latter his
banjo, whereupon a lively tune was struck up and they
played and sang until a late hour.</p>

<p class='c000'>On the following morning the air ship was hovering over
the Atlantic.</p>

<p class='c000'>Pomp had taken charge of the cooking department, and
the Irishman attended to the machinery when it became
necessary.</p>

<p class='c000'>The professor was a very much relieved man.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Had I been incarcerated for that crime,” said he to
Frank, as they went out on deck after breakfast, “I could
not have gone with you, and might have been hung.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“For my part, I was determined that you should not fall
into the detective’s hands,” replied the inventor, “for I was
anxious to have you go with me on this cruise.”</p>

<p class='c000'>They shook out the sails, as the Ranger was going with
the wind, and as the white duck bellied out, speed was added
to the boat.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Do you think we will meet the Red Eric?” asked Vaneyke.</p>

<p class='c000'>“She has considerable start, but we may be able to overhaul
her, as we can make very rapid headway,” Frank replied.
“I owe Captain Ben Bolt a grudge for the scalp
wound he gave me, and I’ll avenge myself by wresting Walter
Grey from his power.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“What is your destination?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“The Kara Sea and the island of Nova Zembla.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“It will be very cold there now.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Well, the boat is well heated, and we have warm fur
clothing on board,” said Frank. “If there is ice on the
island, we can travel over it on the boat’s runners, to examine
the remains of the mammoth you say you wish to get
for the institute you represent.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yes. A gentleman of known veracity saw the body of a
huge beast buried on Nova Zembla, and sent word to that
effect to the Smithsonian, with directions how to find it.
This, of course, is why I was so anxious to go with you, for
I have orders to get part of the remains.”</p>

<p class='c000'>They then went inside.</p>

<p class='c000'>The barometer showed a height of 2,000 feet.</p>

<p class='c000'>Below them lay the north Atlantic, and a number of ships
were seen dotting the surface in different places.</p>

<p class='c000'>A constant watch with telescopes was maintained by those
on duty for some sign of the Red Eric.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>Having reached the British isles the ice ship crossed the
North Sea and sailed along the western coast of Norway.</p>

<p class='c000'>From there she passed over the Barentz Sea at the north
of Russia.</p>

<p class='c000'>Nothing was seen of the whaling ship, and the island of
Nova Zembla finally appeared in the distance.</p>

<p class='c000'>Every day that passed by found the temperature decreasing.</p>

<p class='c000'>Our friends were obliged to put on fur clothing, and the
electric heating apparatus was put in operation.</p>

<p class='c000'>It made the interior of the Ranger warm and comfortable,
and rendered its inmates quite cozy.</p>

<p class='c000'>The mercury in the thermometer had gone down to within
two degrees of zero, and the upper regions of the air became
filled with fine needles of ice that stung the skin of
our friends when exposed to it.</p>

<p class='c000'>But little sunlight was seen each day owing to the winter
season.</p>

<p class='c000'>Moreover, the sky in this region was so filled with heavy
leaden-hued clouds that the meager light was still further
reduced.</p>

<p class='c000'>Upon first observing the icy particles that constantly
filled the air, Frank was very much amazed, and involuntarily
cried:</p>

<p class='c000'>“We have been driven adrift in a frozen sky.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“There is the island of Nova Zembla now,” said the professor,
pointing away to the northeastward. “It is a land
the interior of which has never been explored yet.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank did not like the appearance of the island.</p>

<p class='c000'>It looked like an elongated crescent, 600 miles long by
60 wide, and lay between 70 degrees 30 minutes and 77
degrees N. latitude and 52 degrees and 60 minutes E. longitude.</p>

<p class='c000'>Its northeastern extremity was west of the meridian of
Yalmal peninsula, and its southern was separated from
Vaygach island by Kara Strait, 30 miles wide.</p>

<p class='c000'>Nova Zembla was cut through the middle by a narrow
winding channel called the Matotchkin Shar connecting the
Arctic Ocean with the Kara Sea.</p>

<p class='c000'>Upon a nearer approach to it Frank closely examined
the place with a glass, and gained a fair idea of the interior.</p>

<p class='c000'>The western coast was greatly indented by fjord-like
bays and studded with many islands, and was less ice-bound
than might be supposed, as a continuation of the warm
current of the Gulf Stream flowed along the coast.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the interior was an alpine region with isolated mountain
peaks, a complicated system of spurs and deep valleys
extending even under the sea.</p>

<p class='c000'>At the north was a vast swelling of land covered with an
immense ice sheet descending north and south to the sea
coast.</p>

<p class='c000'>All this region was covered with fields of snow descending
in broad strips along the slopes of the isolated peaks, and
feeding mighty glaciers in the deeper valleys.</p>

<p class='c000'>While Frank was sizing up the desolate place a dense fall
of snow began that hid the island from his view.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was impossible to see where they were going, and as
the wind had shifted around, it became necessary to furl
the sails.</p>

<p class='c000'>Leaving the old professor at the wheel, Frank called the
coon and the Irishman to help him, and they went out on
deck.</p>

<p class='c000'>Mingled with the great clouds of down-falling snowflakes
were the dreadful needles of ice that stung their eyes, were
inhaled in their lungs, and fairly penetrated their skin.</p>

<p class='c000'>The halliards were slackened off, and as the canvas fell in
lazy-jacks the work of furling was reduced to a minimum.</p>

<p class='c000'>Down fluttered the square sails from the yards, while
the staysails were hauled to the bowsprit by the down-hauls.</p>

<p class='c000'>Barney was at the mainmast, Pomp at the foremast, and
Frank had gone up forward.</p>

<p class='c000'>The wind was driving the ice and snow in their faces.</p>

<p class='c000'>As soon as the canvas was down on the yards, the darky
and the Celt ran up the shrouds to tie it down with gaskets.</p>

<p class='c000'>All hands worked like beavers.</p>

<p class='c000'>The sails had nearly all been fastened when the coon and
the inventor were suddenly startled by hearing a wild yell
from Barney.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was followed by a snap like a pistol shot.</p>

<p class='c000'>The foot rope had parted under the Irishman.</p>

<p class='c000'>He fell toward the deck.</p>

<p class='c000'>As he felt himself going he flung out his hands.</p>

<p class='c000'>They encountered a back stay, and he grasped it tightly.</p>

<p class='c000'>There came a violent shock on the rope, and it parted
under the weight of the Celt’s body, but he retained his hold
on the lower portion of it, and took a rapid turn of it around
his arm.</p>

<p class='c000'>Down he shot like a stone.</p>

<p class='c000'>A shout of alarm escaped Frank when he saw his friend
flying through the air, and go over the railing.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Lost!” gasped the inventor, in tones of dread.</p>

<p class='c000'>He rushed to the side, and Pomp hastened down from the
yards.</p>

<p class='c000'>Barney gave himself up for lost, for the Ranger was then
at a height of 2,000 feet from the sea, and he knew he was
bound to perish before landing in the water.</p>

<p class='c000'>When he had reached the end of the broken stay, however,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>he paused with a shock that nearly pulled his arm out
of joint, and wrung a groan of agony from his lips.</p>

<p class='c000'>His body bounced in the air, and came down again with
another jerk that fairly made him howl with pain.</p>

<p class='c000'>But the turn of the rope around his arm saved his life,
and he swung there like a clock pendulum.</p>

<p class='c000'>For a moment poor Barney was dazed.</p>

<p class='c000'>As soon as he had sufficiently recovered his wits, though,
he seized the rope with the other hand.</p>

<p class='c000'>That eased the strain on his arm and relieved his pain.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Be heavens! I’m aloive!” he gasped.</p>

<p class='c000'>He was panting hard, but in a few moments he yelled:</p>

<p class='c000'>“Help! Help!”</p>

<p class='c000'>Just then Frank reached the railing.</p>

<p class='c000'>Peering over he saw the Irishman.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Thunder!” he cried, with a thrill of hope darting
through him.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Am he gone?” cried Pomp, reaching the deck.</p>

<p class='c000'>“No; help me haul up the broken stay.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Wha? fo’?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“He’s on the end of it.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Glory halleluyah!”</p>

<p class='c000'>They both grasped the line and began to haul the Irishman
up.</p>

<p class='c000'>Barney was pulled half-way up to the deck in this manner,
when suddenly there came a shout from the professor.</p>

<p class='c000'>“The ice ship is falling!”</p>

<p class='c000'>Such was the cry that startled Frank.</p>

<p class='c000'>He glanced up at the gyroscopes.</p>

<p class='c000'>They were moving very slowly compared to the speed at
which they had been spinning.</p>

<p class='c000'>The cause was apparent to Frank at a glance.</p>

<p class='c000'>Holding the falling ice and snow, the metal spars were so
cold that the flakes congealed around the pivots, choking
them so that the ice thus formed interfered with their revolutions.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='V' class='c009'>CHAPTER V.<br /> <span class='large'>BARNEY AND THE BEAR.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c012'>“Pomp, we are going down into the sea!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Golly! Marse Frank, am de machinery bruck?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“No; but ice is forming around the gyroscopes so they
can’t revolve.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Fo’ de Lawd’s sake, hist up Barney, den, or he drop in
de sea!”</p>

<p class='c000'>They pulled the imperiled Irishman up to the deck, and
he heaved a great sigh of relief when he had a firm footing
once more.</p>

<p class='c000'>Shaking off the broken backstay that saved him, he exclaimed:</p>

<p class='c000'>“Faith, I’d rather froze ter death up here than doy be
fallin’ into ther say!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“There really isn’t much choice in the matter,” said
Frank; “for we are going down anyway. Hey, Dr. Vaneyke!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Well?” asked the old scientist.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Put every volt of force into the stern screw.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“What for?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“To try and reach land, sir.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The professor pulled the screw lever over, and with increased
speed the flying ice ship darted through the snowflakes
to the eastward.</p>

<p class='c000'>Vaneyke had got his bearings before the blinding storm
began, and although the Ranger was swiftly descending,
she kept going to the landward at terrific velocity.</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank saw that the sails no longer interfered with the
movements of the ice ship, and as he and his companions
were very cold, they passed into the pilot house.</p>

<p class='c000'>A shout suddenly pealed from Barney.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Land ahead! Port yer hullum!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“A mountain!” gasped the doctor, obeying.</p>

<p class='c000'>“We won’t land in the sea, at any rate,” said Frank.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yo’ know whar yo’ am, sah?” asked the coon.</p>

<p class='c000'>“No,” answered the professor, shaking his head. “But
once we alight we will soon find Matotchkin Shar, and as
most of the whalers winter there at the Norwegian fishing
stations, we will be very apt to find the Red Eric there later,
if not now.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“We must have passed her,” said Frank.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Howly floy!” gasped Barney, looking out of the window,
“there’s ther say beneath us again!”</p>

<p class='c000'>It was a broad sheet of water, sure enough, but the inventor
turned the electric current into the searchlight.</p>

<p class='c000'>As the bright glare pierced the falling flakes he saw
that it was a stream of water over which they were flying.</p>

<p class='c000'>In a moment the truth of the matter dawned upon his
mind.</p>

<p class='c000'>“It is the Matotchkin Shar, the strait that cuts this
island in two!” he exclaimed. “See, we approach a shore.”</p>

<p class='c000'>He pointed ahead.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Ranger was then dangerously close to the water.</p>

<p class='c000'>But she was going ahead like a thunderbolt.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was fair to presume that she would soon reach land,
and as this place was covered with ice, they rightly concluded
that it was the northern side of the stream.</p>

<p class='c000'>In a few moments more Frank stopped the driving wheel.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>The Ranger was then but ten yards above the water, and
still falling fast; but she was close to the shore.</p>

<p class='c000'>By the time she alighted she had left the stream astern.</p>

<p class='c000'>Her runners and side wheels acted like flanges in holding
her bolt upright, and the impetus given her by her flight
sent her gliding on her runners over the sparkling ice.</p>

<p class='c000'>It moderated the shock of her descent.</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank had taken entire charge of her now.</p>

<p class='c000'>He at once dropped the gyroscopes.</p>

<p class='c000'>Grasping the lever which raised or lowered the side
wheels, he gave it a sudden pull, for he saw the boat swiftly
gliding toward an immense crevice in the ice.</p>

<p class='c000'>Down went the spiked wheels with a crash, and acting
like a brake, as they were rigid, they scratched over the surface
for some distance, and finally stopped the boat.</p>

<p class='c000'>This occurred only just in time, for the Ranger had
reached the edge of the chasm as she paused.</p>

<p class='c000'>The place was dangerous.</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank saw this, and turning a switch, he put an electric
current in the side-wheel motor, reversing it, and she
backed away, the wheels digging into the ice, and moving
the Ranger very easily.</p>

<p class='c000'>They were then upon an immense glacier running down a
valley embowered between two mountains.</p>

<p class='c000'>Having brought the ship to a pause, Frank went up the
masts and examined the gyroscope pivots.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was utterly impossible to keep them clear of the ice
without resorting to some artificial means of keeping the
spars warm.</p>

<p class='c000'>This he explained to his friends on his return.</p>

<p class='c000'>Various plans were suggested until at length Frank
thought of running platinum wires into all the hollow tubes
and connecting them with the electric heating apparatus
in the engine-room.</p>

<p class='c000'>To carry out this would require time, and as they had
plenty of it to spare, they began to try the experiment.</p>

<p class='c000'>The following day had dawned before the wires were arranged
according to Frank’s plans, and the snow-storm had
stopped.</p>

<p class='c000'>When the current was turned into them, the ice soon
began to melt on the spars and the gyroscopes spun freely.</p>

<p class='c000'>The experiment was a perfect success.</p>

<p class='c000'>“We can go up in the sky without fear now,” said Frank,
smilingly, as they sat down to breakfast.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Suppose we run for the Norwegian fishing station and
consult its inhabitants about the Red Eric?” asked Vaneyke.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Is it on this soide av ther strame?” asked Barney.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yes—on the eastern side of the island near the strait.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Gwine up in de frozen sky?” asked Pomp.</p>

<p class='c000'>“No,” answered Frank. “We’ll use the boat’s skates,
as there is plenty of ice all around here, and we can save
trouble by staying down.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Accordingly, after the meal, he ascended to the turret
and started the ice wheels, when the ship glided smoothly
along.</p>

<p class='c000'>The stern runner steered her the same as on any ice-boat,
and was automatically lowered to the ice level.</p>

<p class='c000'>Along sped the Ranger to the eastward, keeping as close
to the stream as possible, so as not to miss any ships that
might be at anchor in the ice-covered water.</p>

<p class='c000'>As the sun only appeared for a few hours at a time, the
days were of very short duration, and they had to keep the
electric lights lit.</p>

<p class='c000'>The storm had left a mantle of snow upon the ice-covered
ground, through which the Ranger’s runners cut like
huge knives, and her crew observed a range of lofty mountains
at the left.</p>

<p class='c000'>They were clad with snow.</p>

<p class='c000'>Scarcely any vegetation was seen, but as they glided
along, view was caught of a few vagrant birds, some lemmings,
ice-fox, and several immigrant reindeer.</p>

<p class='c000'>Oil along the coast, though, countless numbers of ducks,
geese and swan were flying about the rocks, making the air
resonant with their cries and the ceaseless flapping of their
wings.</p>

<p class='c000'>Several miles from the glacier Frank observed a mass of
beetling ice blocks strewn across their path.</p>

<p class='c000'>There were several openings among them, though,
through which he saw he could steer the ship to clearer ice
beyond.</p>

<p class='c000'>“How in the world could these immense blocks of ice
have got there?” asked Dr. Vaneyke in surprise, when he
saw them.</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank pointed to a mountain cliff half a mile away.</p>

<p class='c000'>“If they fell from there” said he, “wouldn’t they have
been propelled along over this glassy surface to the very
strait?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Sure enough, if they came from enough height to project
them a great distance, for they would certainly slide
freely.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Do you notice how much warmer it is here than it was
in the sky, doctor?” asked the young inventor.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Quite a difference in the temperature.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Pshaw! there goes one of those staysails shaking loose!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I’ll go out an’ boind it down, me laddy!” said Barney.</p>

<p class='c000'>He hastened from the turret, and going out on deck,
made his way out to the end of the long bowsprit.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>Barney caught hold of the refractory sail just as the
Ranger ran into the icy pass, and secured it where it belonged.</p>

<p class='c000'>He then started to make his way back to the deck, when
one of the forward runners struck against an icy hummock.</p>

<p class='c000'>It made the ship bounce, and flung Barney from his
perch.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Irishman gave a yell and landed upon his back upon
the ice.</p>

<p class='c000'>He barely had time to roll aside when the grinding runners
flew by within an inch of his body, for Frank had seen
what had befallen him, and swiftly steered the Ranger aside.</p>

<p class='c000'>Had the steel blade hit the Irishman, it would have cut
him in two, for the weight of the boat was considerable, as
it was very large.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Be heavens! I’ve broke me neck!” roared Barney.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Man oberboa’d!” shouted Pomp, seeing the mishap.
“Man oberboa’d!”</p>

<p class='c000'>The coon rushed out on the deck, and when the Ranger
passed Barney, he scrambled to his feet.</p>

<p class='c000'>Running after the ship, he yelled:</p>

<p class='c000'>“Shtop her! Don’t lave me behoind!”</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank had to keep her going a few moments, though, for
there was a bend around which she was dashing.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Ranger quickly distanced him.</p>

<p class='c000'>As he started to rush around the bend after her a huge
brown bear darted out from behind an icy projection in
front of him.</p>

<p class='c000'>Before the startled Irishman could stop himself, he
struck the beast, fell over it and landed on the ice again.</p>

<p class='c000'>The bear uttered a savage growl, and turned upon Barney.</p>

<p class='c000'>Up jumped Barney, very much startled.</p>

<p class='c000'>He wanted to run after the Ranger again, but could not
do so, as the bear was between him and the boat.</p>

<p class='c000'>Seeing the ugly brute coming for him, he clapped his
hand to his belt in search of a weapon to defend himself.</p>

<p class='c000'>He was not armed.</p>

<p class='c000'>A cold chill went over him upon finding this out.</p>

<p class='c000'>He realized that he could not do anything with the beast
now, and taking to his heels, ran away, hotly pursued by
the animal.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='VI' class='c009'>CHAPTER VI.<br /> <span class='large'>THE FISHING STATION.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c012'>None of the Ranger’s crew had seen what had befallen
Barney, as the bend in the pass hid him from their view.</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank, therefore, did not hasten to stop the ice ship’s
wheels, and to his surprise he found her flying down the
side of a steep hill.</p>

<p class='c000'>To stop her now with the brake was almost an utter impossibility,
for the wheels were apt to trip her up.</p>

<p class='c000'>He, therefore, raised them, and let the boat go on her
runners.</p>

<p class='c000'>She gathered speed every moment, as the hill was steep,
and was soon roaring down like a locomotive.</p>

<p class='c000'>The snow flew up in showers from in front of her runners,
and a loud buzzing sound came from them as they cut
through the ice.</p>

<p class='c000'>Away she flew, and reaching the bottom of the hill, Frank
abruptly turned to the right to avoid a mass of rough ice
ahead of her.</p>

<p class='c000'>No sooner did she fly around the base of the hill, when
to their amazement the boat began to sink.</p>

<p class='c000'>She had run into a drift.</p>

<p class='c000'>Above the snow rose the tops of a number of ice huts,
shaped like inverted bowls, and a tremendous shout in a
strange tongue emanated from the huts the boat struck and
crushed in.</p>

<p class='c000'>Some of the inmates of these huts had been hurt.</p>

<p class='c000'>The rest swarmed out into the passages cut through the
drift and got upon the level ground above the hollow where
they had their huts.</p>

<p class='c000'>All of them were dark-skinned people, somewhat resembling
the Esquimaux of North America and Greenland.</p>

<p class='c000'>They wore fur clothing, with pointed hoods for their
heads, and carried walrus spears, muskets and knives in
their hands.</p>

<p class='c000'>Although amazed at the sight of such a peculiar boat
there, these Nova Zembla savages soon recovered from
their surprise, and brandishing their weapons at our friends
whom they now saw, they began to prepare for an attack.</p>

<p class='c000'>Their animosity was aroused by the injury done so innocently
to some of the inmates of the ice huts.</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank could do nothing with the ship but let her stop
of her own accord when she plunged into the snow drift.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Natives!” he exclaimed in surprise, upon seeing them.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Armed and angry at us, too,” added the professor.</p>

<p class='c000'>“We’ve ruined several of their huts.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yes; and injured the inmates of some.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“That’s what they are angry about.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Evidently,” coincided the professor.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I didn’t notice the huts until we were upon them.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Nor I, as they were nearly covered up with the snow.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Just then Pomp came rushing in from the deck.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>The boat had paused, half buried in the snow, and the
coon was covered.</p>

<p class='c000'>He was very much excited, and cried, warningly:</p>

<p class='c000'>“Dey’s a gang ob niggahs out dar gwine ter shoot!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Close the metal shutters over the windows, doctor.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Better start the gyroscopes,” said the professor, complying.</p>

<p class='c000'>Just then the yelling natives fired at the boat, a shower
of arrows, spears and musket bullets striking the Ranger.</p>

<p class='c000'>All the wooden weapons broke against the hull of the ice
ship, and the leaden bullets flattened against the plates.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Where’s Barney?” asked Frank, anxiously.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Done leabe him astern, sah,” Pomp answered.</p>

<p class='c000'>“We must pick him up ere the angry natives see him.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Gwine ter shoot ‘em?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“No. They can’t harm us here.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Look out! They’re jumping on the deck!” said the
doctor.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I’ll soon get rid of them,” Frank answered.</p>

<p class='c000'>He put the gyroscopes in operation, and the air ship
pulled herself up out of the snowbank into the air.</p>

<p class='c000'>A dismal howl of dismay pealed from the throats of the
natives on her deck when they found themselves being carried
up.</p>

<p class='c000'>They lost no time jumping down into the snowdrift, and
when the last man had left her the ones on the ice discharged
a second volley up at her from their weapons.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Ranger mounted to the height of the hill she descended
before Frank stopped her.</p>

<p class='c000'>He then glanced down and saw that there were nearly one
hundred men, women and children standing on the ice
glaring up at the boat.</p>

<p class='c000'>“They are a peculiar race,” he muttered.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Never heard of before,” said the doctor.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Whar am Barney?” asked Pomp.</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank glanced around, but saw no sign of the Irishman.</p>

<p class='c000'>He then steered the boat back to the pass.</p>

<p class='c000'>She was within a dozen feet of the ground, ran back the
way she came from, and had scarcely turned the bend when
Frank heard a tremendous yell from Barney.</p>

<p class='c000'>“This way wid yez, for ther love av Heaven!”</p>

<p class='c000'>Such was his shout.</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank saw him.</p>

<p class='c000'>Perched on an icy ledge.</p>

<p class='c000'>The bear squatted at the bottom.</p>

<p class='c000'>Both glaring at each other!</p>

<p class='c000'>“Jerusalem!” cried the inventor.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Why doan’ yer git down?” laughed Pomp.</p>

<p class='c000'>“He’s cornered in earnest,” the professor remarked,
dryly.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Take the wheel,” said Frank. “I want some bear meat
for dinner.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The professor complied, and the young inventor took a
pneumatic rifle that threw dynamite bombshells and went
outside.</p>

<p class='c000'>Aiming at the bear, he fired one shot.</p>

<p class='c000'>Sput! went the piece, and zing-g-g! went the ball.</p>

<p class='c000'>A loud report was heard when it hit the bear’s head.</p>

<p class='c000'>When the flash of fire and glare of smoke vanished the
bear was lying on its side violently kicking, and the upper
part of its head was scattered to the four winds of heaven.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Bull’s eye!” yelled Barney.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Lower the Ranger!” said Frank.</p>

<p class='c000'>When she alighted the inventor descended the ladder.</p>

<p class='c000'>Walking over to Barney, he asked:</p>

<p class='c000'>“How did he send you to roost?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Faith, he didn’t,” grinned Barney. “I wint av me own
accord.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I don’t see how you got way up there.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“More power to me toes, I clumb ther wall loike a floy.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The Irishman was a dozen feet from the ground, upon a
little shelf that was projecting over an almost smooth wall.</p>

<p class='c000'>When the bear chased him, and he found it gaining, he
ran up this wall by means of the tiny protuberances and
indentations until he reached the edge of the shelf, when he
pulled himself up the rest of the way.</p>

<p class='c000'>If he hadn’t been frightened he couldn’t have done it.</p>

<p class='c000'>Dropping down, he told Frank what had happened to
him, after which they began to skin the bear, and cut away
the choicest parts.</p>

<p class='c000'>These were stowed aboard the ice ship.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was hardly done when Pomp shouted:</p>

<p class='c000'>“Heah come de niggahs!”</p>

<p class='c000'>The natives had been swarming up the hill, and seeing
the boat on the ground, made a grand rush for her.</p>

<p class='c000'>Pomp did not wait for orders.</p>

<p class='c000'>He pulled the gyroscope lever, and the Ranger bounded
up into the air, thwarting them a second time.</p>

<p class='c000'>At a height of 290 feet she paused.</p>

<p class='c000'>Just then Frank entered the turret.</p>

<p class='c000'>He saw at a glance what had happened.</p>

<p class='c000'>“We’ll have to keep up in the sky to avoid those beggars,”
he remarked.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Dey’s boun’ ter git aboa’d.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Apparently. But they won’t succeed.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Gwine ahead, sah?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yes. Right on along the strait.”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>The coon started the boat along through the frozen sky,
and the fine, needle-like particles that filled the air blew into
their faces so strongly that they were forced to close the
window.</p>

<p class='c000'>The natives were left out of sight astern.</p>

<p class='c000'>Finally the sun came up.</p>

<p class='c000'>As its burning rays fell upon the desolate landscape, the
ice gleamed and sparkled like myriads of diamonds.</p>

<p class='c000'>A cold, bleak air was blowing against the boat; but she
ran through it with the greatest of ease, and reached the
water front.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Even had we remained down below, we could not have
traveled over the ice,” remarked Frank. “See there, Pomp,
great chasms in the ground in some places, and insurmountable
hills in other places.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Wha’ yo’ call dat ahead dar neah de ribber?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“A settlement. That’s the place we are searching for.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“An’ dar am some ships along do sho’.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Sure enough. Whalers, every one of them!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Wondah if de Red Eric am among dem?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“That we will soon find out.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Am it time fo’ her to be heah?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“She could, if she was not prevented by floating ice.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I’se jes’ itchin’ ter git dat Walter Grey way from de
capting.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“By this time the poor boy may be dead.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Dead!” muttered Pomp, aghast.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yes; Ben Bolt may have killed him,” said Frank.</p>

<p class='c000'>Just then the doctor and Barney came up from below.</p>

<p class='c000'>As soon as Vaneyke saw the settlement, he said:</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yes; that’s the Norwegian fishing settlement. See the
flag?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Do most of the Kara Sea whalers meet here, sir?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“They have to until the cold weather is over.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“But the water is pretty well open, professor.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yes, I know it’s a mild winter, but if the Red Eric
comes to this sea at all, she will stop at that fishing station,
I’m sure. I’m glad we’ve found the place, for it’s near here
the body of the mastodon I’m after is to be found buried in
the ground.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The air ship continued on toward the wretched little
cluster of wooden huts and soon reached them.</p>

<p class='c000'>News of her approach had been communicated to the inhabitants
and the crews of the ships.</p>

<p class='c000'>They were all grouped on the shore watching the ice ship.</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank sent the Ranger down on the ice near them, and
they all made a rush for her to find out what she was.</p>

<p class='c000'>In a few moments the ship was surrounded by the curious
throng.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='VII' class='c009'>CHAPTER VII.<br /> <span class='large'>INTO DANGEROUS GROUND.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c012'>There were three whaling ships in winter quarters off the
Norwegian fishing station, and all were from the United
States.</p>

<p class='c000'>The American sailors were among the Norwegians, and
when they saw the stars and stripes fluttering from one of
the Ranger’s masts, they set up a loud cheer.</p>

<p class='c000'>Both captains then hailed Frank, asking what sort of
craft the flying ice ship was, and he told them and asked:</p>

<p class='c000'>“Has the Red Eric, of Boston, arrived here yet?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“No, sir,” replied one of the captains; “but as we know
she is coming here, we are on the lookout for her daily.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Is the captain a friend of yours?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Oh, no; nor any one else’s, for that matter,” replied the
whaler. “He’s a very ugly man, who is not liked very much
by any one.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I’m glad to hear that, for he certainly is a bad man, and
I can prove it. He was paid to shanghai a boy whom he has
got aboard his vessel, and we are going to help the lad to
escape.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“It’s just like him. But how did it come about?”</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank detailed Walter Grey’s history.</p>

<p class='c000'>At its conclusion, he added:</p>

<p class='c000'>“Ben Bolt shot me. I am going to arrest him for it.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“If we meet the rascal and you don’t happen to be
around, you can rest assured that we will make him produce
the boy.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Good enough!”</p>

<p class='c000'>After some more talk they parted.</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank sent the ship up into the frozen air.</p>

<p class='c000'>Turning to Dr. Vaneyke, he said to him, cheerily:</p>

<p class='c000'>“Now, then, to find the mastodon, professor.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Going now?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yes; produce your directions.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The professor drew a paper from his pocket.</p>

<p class='c000'>He carefully read it over and then said:</p>

<p class='c000'>“The man who discovered the remains said they were to
be found in the ground at the head of Tchekin Bay, fifty
miles north of here, on the eastern coast. The place is
marked by a solitary cedar tree.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“We shall be there in little more than an hour.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank turned the flying ice ship up the coast.</p>

<p class='c000'>As she passed the place haunted by the birds they flew
away in fear, with a tremendous chorus of screams and violent
whirring of wings.</p>

<p class='c000'>The waves of the Kara Sea were breaking in a long line
of foamy surf along the icy coast, and far out upon the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>heaving waters great bergs and ice floes were seen drifting
along.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was bitterly cold in the frozen sky, and the moisture
from the low-hanging, gloomy clouds covered the Ranger
with their vapor, which was quickly converted into slippery
ice.</p>

<p class='c000'>She was completely glazed with it in a short time, but
the hot wires in the hollow masts kept the pivots free at the
gyroscopes.</p>

<p class='c000'>Pomp went down into the engine-room to lubricate the
machinery, and as Barney was already there, he dodged out
of sight behind a dynamo, from whence, he narrowly
watched the darky’s movements.</p>

<p class='c000'>The fun-loving Irishman had not forgotten the trick
Pomp played on him in the Boston hotel.</p>

<p class='c000'>He now saw a chance of evening matters up with the
coon.</p>

<p class='c000'>Unconscious of his danger, the diminutive darky went
from one oil-cup to another, with the oil-can in his hand,
filling them up.</p>

<p class='c000'>As he was passing the dynamo behind which Barney
crouched, the Celt passed a copper wire around his ankle
and rapidly bound it there.</p>

<p class='c000'>On went Pomp a few paces and paused at a point to be
oiled.</p>

<p class='c000'>The moment he touched the metal lid of the cup to open
it, an electric shock flew through him that made him spring
in the air.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Ouch! Fo’ de lan’s sake!” he yelled. “Wha’ dat?”</p>

<p class='c000'>He shook his fingers, glared at the oil-cup, and then
pondered.</p>

<p class='c000'>The wire Barney fastened to his leg was secured to one
pole of the dynamo, and the Irishman had another wire
from the other pole to the metal floor.</p>

<p class='c000'>As the machinery was bolted to the floor, the moment
Pomp touched any of the metal work, a complete circuit was
made with his body, and a terrific shock was the result.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Irishman chuckled over the success of his plan.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Specs dey mus’ hab been some current in dat cup,” muttered
the coon. “But dey ain’t no ‘lectrical connection dat
I kin see.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Feeling safe to go on with his work, he grasped the oil-cup
cover again and made a second attempt to open it.</p>

<p class='c000'>This time the shock was heavier.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Wow!” shrieked the coon, and dropping the oil-can, he
gave another jump and started off on a run.</p>

<p class='c000'>He didn’t go far before he reached the end of the wire.</p>

<p class='c000'>As he was going full speed, the jerk on his ankle pulled
his leg from under him and he went to the floor with a
bang.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Sen’ fo’ de undahtakah! I’se a dead niggah!” he
yelled, frantically.</p>

<p class='c000'>He reached out his hand to assist himself to rise, but the
contact with the floor completed the circuit again.</p>

<p class='c000'>A wild whoop escaped him.</p>

<p class='c000'>He humped up his back and bounced to his feet.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I’se full ob it!” he howled. “Somebuddy insulate me!”</p>

<p class='c000'>Just then he caught sight of the wire that tripped him.</p>

<p class='c000'>He thought it was a loose piece into which his foot got
tangled.</p>

<p class='c000'>Intending to disengage it, he hoisted up the bound foot
across his knee, and to balance himself reached out one
hand and grasped one of the metal posts.</p>

<p class='c000'>Another shock followed.</p>

<p class='c000'>Pomp let out a roar that would have done credit to a
Comanche.</p>

<p class='c000'>He relaxed his hold on the post as if it were red hot, and
made a wild rush for the other end of the room, bawling:</p>

<p class='c000'>“De hull ship’s ‘lectrified! Tu’n on de hose! Lor’
amighty, put me out! I’se ‘lectrocuted! Help, help,
help!”</p>

<p class='c000'>Snap went the wire from his ankle just then.</p>

<p class='c000'>It had necessarily been put on insecurely, and he gained
his freedom.</p>

<p class='c000'>Barney could not hold in his mirth any longer, for the
comical antics of the coon tickled him immensely.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Roon ye spalpeen, roon!” he yelled, popping up from
behind the dynamo. “If yez lucks back, yez will busht loike
a bomb!”</p>

<p class='c000'>Pomp paused.</p>

<p class='c000'>It instantly flashed across his mind that Barney was responsible
for the shocks he received, for the Celt was laughing
immoderately.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Lord amassa!” he gasped. “Yo’ done dat, I’ish?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Is it ter me yez are alludin’ wid disrespect?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Jes’ tell me dat—yo’ done gib me dat ‘lectricity?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Faix, it’s an insoolt yez trow me be yez suspishey!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Once mo’, Barney O’Shea,” roared Pomp. “Yo’ done
dat?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Do yez take me for an electric eel?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Dat wuz a great joke,” sadly said Pomp, returning. “I
done gib yo’ credit fo’ dat, yo’ ole flannel-mouf terrier!
Shake han’s on it. Dat’s one on me, honey, sho’s yo’ born!”</p>

<p class='c000'>He extended his big paw, and Barney roared laughing.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Be heavens!” said he, “it’s the divil we O’Sheas bes at
playin’ good wans on ther naygurs. I’m glad yez take it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>loike a man. Here’s me fisht, and may ther next wan bate
this joke.”</p>

<p class='c000'>He slapped his hand into the coon’s.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Hurroar!” he yelled. “I’se got yer! Take dat, yo’
babboon! An’ dat, yo’ ole snoozer! An’ dat, yo’ blamed
son ob a gorilla!”</p>

<p class='c000'>And biff—bang—boom! went his foot.</p>

<p class='c000'>Every time he let fly Barney was raised from the floor.</p>

<p class='c000'>As soon as he recovered from his astonishment, he struggled
to get away, but Pomp had a grip like a vise upon him
and would not let go until he booted the Celt all around the
room.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Be heavens! I thought yez was frindly,” raved Barney.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yo’ did, huh? So I is, chile. I lub yo’ like a brudder.
Golly! how much mo’ yo’ spec ob a feller?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Lave go av me!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Not till I’se got froo.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I’ll be afther butcherin’ yez!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“G’wan! Yo done dat already!”</p>

<p class='c000'>And with a parting hoister Pomp let him go.</p>

<p class='c000'>Barney put on a sickly but winning smile and extended
his hand.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Shake hands. It’s quits we are intoirely,” he observed,
sweetly.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Git out ob heah, yo’ white trash!” bellowed Pomp, picking
up an ax. “Wanter play de same game on me, hey?
Guess not, honey. Dey ain’t no flies on dis coon, an’ don’
yo’ forgit it!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“See here, me buck——”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Clar out, or I’se gwine ter scalp yo’ wif dis!”</p>

<p class='c000'>And Pomp had such a ferocious look upon his face as he
rushed for Barney, with the ax uplifted, that the Irishman
took flight and fled from the room, gasping:</p>

<p class='c000'>“Begorry, the naygur’s off his nut, an’ there’ll be a bloody
ruction here wid me for ther coorpse av I sthay.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Pomp was satisfied.</p>

<p class='c000'>A large ripe grin overspread his mug.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Beat him dat time,” he chuckled.</p>

<p class='c000'>He laid aside the ax, and picking up the oil-can, resumed
his work with no further molestation from the Irishman.</p>

<p class='c000'>All this time the ice boat had been going on up the coast.
In due course of time she reached the bay they were looking
for, and the professor located the lone cedar tree.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Very well,” said Frank, as he did so.</p>

<p class='c000'>A queer sensation at once assailed the Ranger.</p>

<p class='c000'>Surprised at this Frank glanced out of the window.</p>

<p class='c000'>Here a startling sight met his view.</p>

<p class='c000'>The ground seemed to be sinking under the weight of the
Ranger.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Good Heaven! What’s this?” he gasped.</p>

<p class='c000'>“There must be soft ground under us,” replied Vaneyke.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I’ll raise the boat again.”</p>

<p class='c000'>He grasped the gyroscope lever and turned it, but though
the wheels spun around the ice ship did not rise.</p>

<p class='c000'>Her runners and wheels had become caught and held
fast by the treacherous ground under her.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='VIII' class='c009'>CHAPTER VIII.<br /> <span class='large'>THE MAMMOTH.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c012'>Leaving the boat in the professor’s care, Frank rushed out
on deck, and peering over at the ground, he saw that it was
sinking down beneath the weight of the boat.</p>

<p class='c000'>The ice covering had given way, exposing a muddy marsh,
up from which a terrible stench was rising.</p>

<p class='c000'>The smell came from the rotting carcase of a huge mammoth
lying buried in the mud.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was the animal which Vaneyke was hunting for.</p>

<p class='c000'>This creature had probably stepped into the marsh centuries
before, and sinking into the mire, was buried alive.</p>

<p class='c000'>It had been preserved by the swamp freezing around it,
and thus would have kept for an indefinite period, had not
a thaw set in which rapidly decomposed the enormous body.</p>

<p class='c000'>Exposed to Frank’s view was an elephantine head, covered
with dry, dark-gray skin, furnished with tufts of hairs,
the neck was covered with a long flowing mane, and a reddish
wool grew all over the exposed parts.</p>

<p class='c000'>The long, curved tusks were ten feet in length.</p>

<p class='c000'>“What a stench! It is awful!” he muttered, holding
his nose. “The mud has hold of the wheels and runners.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Having seen how the Ranger was held. Frank dashed inside,
and telling the professor what he had seen, he pulled
the levers controlling the side wheels and driving screw.</p>

<p class='c000'>As they began slowly to revolve, the mud flew up from
them in showers, and the runners having been thus cleared,
the ascensional force of the gyroscopes lifted the ship up.</p>

<p class='c000'>She freed herself this way and rose a few feet, then darted
away.</p>

<p class='c000'>Then Frank stopped her machinery.</p>

<p class='c000'>The professor had gone outside.</p>

<p class='c000'>He viewed what little there was of the carcase on the
surface, and going back again, he said to Frank:</p>

<p class='c000'>“We can’t do anything with that object in the state it
is in now.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“What do you propose to do?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Only carry away the skeleton.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Strip it of that rotten flesh?”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>“No; we can let the scavengers of this neighborhood do
that for us.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“How do you mean, doctor?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Blow the mud away from around that body so as to leave
it exposed. The odor will attract the foxes and the wolves
here. They will devour the flesh, picking the bones dry.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“If they eat all the rotten meat,” said Frank, “as there
are tons upon tons of it, there will be enough for an army.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“As the food here is very scarce,” replied the old scientist,
“the wild beasts are ravenous, and as there are vast
numbers of them, they will soon get away with it.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“We might try the experiment, anyway.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“How shall I go about it, Frank?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I’ll attend to it. You keep the ship over the marsh.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank went to the storeroom as he spoke, and procured
two fifty-pound bombshells, to each of which he fastened a
wire.</p>

<p class='c000'>Taking them out on deck, he let them drop one after the
other down into the mud, on each side of the mammoth.</p>

<p class='c000'>They sunk deeply by their own weight, coming from a
height, and the other ends of the electric wires remained in
Frank’s hand.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Raise the ice ship a hundred feet!” he sang out.</p>

<p class='c000'>Dr. Vaneyke complied, there being plenty slack wire attached
to the bombs.</p>

<p class='c000'>Then Frank handed him the ends of the wire, and said:</p>

<p class='c000'>“In a minute you can touch them to the battery binding-post.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“All right,” said the professor, with a nod, and Frank
went out again.</p>

<p class='c000'>Peering down, he saw that they were at a safe distance
from the place where the shells would explode.</p>

<p class='c000'>“When the ordinary gun-powder shell is fired on the
battlefield,” he muttered, “if it explodes in front of a man,
he will get killed, while if it bursts behind him, the man
will not be injured, for the force is all thrown forward.
Now, in this case, as the shells will be burst from the upper
side, the force will be downward, and that will throw the
mud up, I think.”</p>

<p class='c000'>But just here the professor touched the wires to the battery,
a current passed down to the shells, and they exploded.</p>

<p class='c000'>A smothered roar was heard, and a tremendous mass of
mud was blown so high in the air that some of it spattered
the upper part of the flying ice ship.</p>

<p class='c000'>When it subsided Frank looked down and saw that a huge
pit had been rent in the marsh, and in the middle of it laid
the body of an enormous mammoth.</p>

<p class='c000'>The carcase was somewhat mutilated by the shells, but
none of the limbs had been torn off.</p>

<p class='c000'>A mass of black, muddy water ran back into the holes
from the ground and settled around the body of the mammoth.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Well,” asked the professor, “what luck?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“The body is exposed. Come out here,” said Frank, as
he wound in the wire with which the shells were burst.</p>

<p class='c000'>Dr. Vaneyke complied, and was well satisfied.</p>

<p class='c000'>After a short survey, he said:</p>

<p class='c000'>“We’ll soon have that skeleton. Wait here awhile, and
you will see for yourself.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Over an hour passed by.</p>

<p class='c000'>Then a dismal howling began.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was repeated from different quarters.</p>

<p class='c000'>They soon saw wolves and foxes swarming from every direction
toward the body of the mammoth.</p>

<p class='c000'>A horrible scene followed.</p>

<p class='c000'>The wolves fought the foxes to keep them away from the
carcase, and began to tear the mammoth to pieces.</p>

<p class='c000'>Dozens, hundreds, thousands came from all points of
the compass, and a frightful struggle went on amid snarls
and yells, and the flesh was torn from the mammoth’s body
rapidly.</p>

<p class='c000'>“There’s no use remaining here any longer,” said Frank,
“for it will take several days to finish devouring all that putrid
meat. Let us leave. We can return and gather up the
bones.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Where do you intend to go?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“In search of the Red Eric.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Very well.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Barney and Pomp had come out on deck, and it was
decided to send the ice ship down over the Archangel Sea,
there to wait and watch for the whaler, no objection being
raised.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was getting so uncomfortably cold out on deck that our
friends were glad to go inside again.</p>

<p class='c000'>The boat was steered away to the southward.</p>

<p class='c000'>They spent a week in the frozen sky, searching for some
trace of the whaler, but failed to see her.</p>

<p class='c000'>Far in the north the ocean was frozen up and covered
with drift ice which the currents carried to the southward.</p>

<p class='c000'>But the warm current of the Gulf Stream kept the Russian
shore-water clear enough for any ships to pass on to
Nova Zembla, so they expected to see the Red Eric come
along any moment.</p>

<p class='c000'>Every day that went by the weather grew colder.</p>

<p class='c000'>Terrible hail storms, blinding snow falls and fierce tempests
were now of daily occurrence.</p>

<p class='c000'>The thermometer mercury sank below zero, and the icy
<span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>particles in the frozen sky became so dense that at times
it formed a mist which they could not see through.</p>

<p class='c000'>Indeed, it was dangerous to go out in it.</p>

<p class='c000'>These fine needles attacked their skins so fiercely that it
made their faces bleed and threatened to destroy their sight.</p>

<p class='c000'>The moon looked like a big, crooked ball of fire, the
aurora borealis played in beautiful colors in the northern
sky, and the short days grew shorter still.</p>

<p class='c000'>A suspicion that the whaler was not going to the Kara
Sea now began to dawn upon Frank’s mind.</p>

<p class='c000'>One morning he said to Dr. Vaneyke:</p>

<p class='c000'>“I fear we have had our journey here for nothing.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Nonsense!” replied the professor. “Isn’t it something
to get the bones of that mammoth, Frank?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Of little consequence to me in view of the more important
work I have on hand,” the inventor replied. “By this
time the bones must be picked clean.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Then suppose we go back and gather them up.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I have no objections.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Just then Barney called down from the turret:</p>

<p class='c000'>“Sail ho! Sail ho!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Where away?” cried Frank, running up-stairs.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Beyant ter ther northaist. But it isn’t ther Red Eric.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“How do you know?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Onless me eyes decaive me it’s ther ship Sally Ann.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank now saw the ship.</p>

<p class='c000'>She was a whaler, cruising along below them.</p>

<p class='c000'>Barney was right. It was not the Red Eric.</p>

<p class='c000'>“But perhaps the crew might know about the latter vessel,”
thought Frank, and he said aloud: “Descend, until
I speak to her captain.”</p>

<p class='c000'>While Barney lowered the ice ship, Frank went out on
deck.</p>

<p class='c000'>They were soon hovering over the vessel, and he addressed
her crew, telling them what the Ranger was, and asking
about the Red Eric.</p>

<p class='c000'>“See her?” repeated the captain. “Of course I did. I
was in her company several days. She is up in the North
now.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Where am I to find her?” eagerly asked Frank.</p>

<p class='c000'>“She came up from Boston nearly a week ago, and has
gone into winter quarters in Nordenskjold bay.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Does she intend to remain there?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yes—until spring.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank spoke at some length further.</p>

<p class='c000'>Then he bade the captain adieu, and said to the professor:</p>

<p class='c000'>“Start back for Tchekin bay, and we’ll get the mammoth’s
bones. After that, in order to approach the Red
Eric unseen, we will go toward her quarters overland.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Good!” cried the scientist. “We may save the boy yet.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The air ship flew back to Nova Zembla, and headed for
the marsh where the mammoth’s body had been.</p>

<p class='c000'>When they reached the place they found nothing but the
animal’s skeleton, and took it aboard.</p>

<p class='c000'>Then they started off to find Ben Bolt’s ship.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='IX' class='c009'>CHAPTER IX.<br /> <span class='large'>CAUGHT IN A TRAP.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c012'>An immense plain of ice stretched away ahead of the
Ranger, and an hour after she started, with Barney at the
wheel, Frank came rushing in from the deck, and cried,
suddenly:</p>

<p class='c000'>“Let her go for all she’s worth!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“What’s the matter?” asked the startled Celt.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Look back there and you’ll see!”</p>

<p class='c000'>The Irishman did so, and a pallor overspread his freckled
face as he saw that the Ranger was being pursued by an
immense cyclonic cloud which was sweeping over the island.</p>

<p class='c000'>It extended from the sky to the ground, black as ink,
vivid tongues of lightning flying out of it, and it swept
everything before it with irresistible fury.</p>

<p class='c000'>Blocks of ice were flying through the air with the force
of cannon balls, great clouds of it, ground to powder, rolled
up like a fog before the rush of wind, and a roaring of the
gale arose that sounded dreadful.</p>

<p class='c000'>Barney put full speed in the driving wheels.</p>

<p class='c000'>Click, click, click! they dug into the ice, the Ranger
rushed on at a tremendous rate, and a wild buzz arose from
the flying spokes and from under the steel runners.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Be heavens! if that thing stroikes us it’s all over wid
ther Ranger but ther shoutin’!” cried the Celt, nervously.</p>

<p class='c000'>“We may be able to outstrip it in a race,” said Frank.</p>

<p class='c000'>“It’s a-gainin’ on us now.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“We’ll hoist the sails.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Can’t we rise in ther air an’ escape it?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“No; don’t you see that it would reach us before we got
above it?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Thrue for you, Misther Frank.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The inventor dashed out on deck again, where Pomp
and the doctor then were swiftly unfurling the sails.</p>

<p class='c000'>Lending them his assistance, Frank quickly succeeded in
getting the canvas up, and as there was a beam wind they
hauled around the braces and stays, and the speed of the
Ranger was materially increased.</p>

<p class='c000'>She was now flying over the ice with all the speed at her
command, and made a mile a minute.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>The terrible cyclone was roaring on in her wake, its sable
cloud spreading over a large tract of territory.</p>

<p class='c000'>“We hold our own so far,” muttered the doctor.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Golly, dis am wuss dan a lightnin’ express train,” said
Pomp.</p>

<p class='c000'>“It’s lucky we’ve got a clear field of ice ahead,” Frank
remarked, as he clutched the railing. “If we hadn’t, that
monster would soon reach us and hurl the Ranger up in the
air.”</p>

<p class='c000'>They had to watch the sails closely.</p>

<p class='c000'>The canvas was bulging as if it would burst from the
bolt ropes, and the wheel motors inside were fairly howling
as the armatures flew around at the top of the speed imparted
by the battery.</p>

<p class='c000'>Along they shot, the terrific pace undiminished, the runner’s
bumping over the lumpy spots, crashing across the
cracks, and plowing up the snow they encountered.</p>

<p class='c000'>Mile after mile was covered.</p>

<p class='c000'>The exciting race was kept up for the northeast, for the
cyclone followed the trend of the land.</p>

<p class='c000'>Suddenly the strain on one of the square sails became so
great that it burst in two with a report like a gun-shot.</p>

<p class='c000'>In a moment the tattered canvas was wildly flying ahead
from the yard, and as considerable power was lost, the
speed of the Ranger was slightly diminished.</p>

<p class='c000'>It made a vast difference, for the storm now began to
gradually gain upon the ice ship.</p>

<p class='c000'>The cloud was only a mile behind them.</p>

<p class='c000'>“What a misfortune!” muttered Frank, in disgust.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Kain’t we rig a new sail, honey?” asked the coon.</p>

<p class='c000'>“We couldn’t,” replied the doctor. “We haven’t got
strength enough. The wind would tear the canvas from our
hands.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Just then a shower of small icy lumps carried on in advance
of the storm struck the boat.</p>

<p class='c000'>It rattled against her like a volley of bullets.</p>

<p class='c000'>Pelted all over, Frank and his companions were obliged
to run into the turret for protection.</p>

<p class='c000'>The missiles flying through the frozen sky in back of the
first ones were very large.</p>

<p class='c000'>As the Ranger continued to lose ground she now began to
get pelted with these lumps.</p>

<p class='c000'>Every blow that struck her gave back a metallic ring and
the clattering clash of the ice breaking.</p>

<p class='c000'>Barney now observed some vast ice hills off to the northwest
about a league, and pointing at them, he said:</p>

<p class='c000'>“Faith, it’s pertection we’d be afther havin’ if we wor ter
get undher shelter av thim cliffs, sor.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Steer for them,” said Frank.</p>

<p class='c000'>“But we’se gwine ter lose ground if we does.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Never mind, Pomp; we’re losing, anyway.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Begorra! we’re in a bad fix entoirely!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“By heading for those cliffs we’ll have a free wind,” said
Vaneyke.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Good! You are right,” cried Frank. “That will increase
our speed.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Around spun the wheel which had been geared to the ice
rudder, and as the boat swung off on the new tick, Frank
and the coon hastened out, and slackened off the braces.</p>

<p class='c000'>Around went the yards.</p>

<p class='c000'>The wind now caught them free.</p>

<p class='c000'>Instantly the ship’s speed was increased.</p>

<p class='c000'>They did not feel the wind, now that they were going
with it, but they continued to lose ground by tacking
athwart the course of the cyclone, and the pelting ice blocks
continued.</p>

<p class='c000'>All hands were kept busy dodging them.</p>

<p class='c000'>One of these blocks struck Pomp in the back and knocked
him across the slippery deck.</p>

<p class='c000'>He would have gone overboard, had Frank not reached
out his hand and seized him.</p>

<p class='c000'>Such a fall would have meant certain death for the darky,
as the ice ship would have left him astern, and the raging
storm would soon have reached and destroyed him.</p>

<p class='c000'>They could do nothing further out there, so in they dove
again.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Ranger now resounded from the repeated blows she
received; but she was rapidly nearing the icy cliffs.</p>

<p class='c000'>Barney worked the wheel like a veteran ice boatman, and
kept his eyes open for pitfalls filled with snow and crevices
that could trip the boat or wedge the runners.</p>

<p class='c000'>There were many openings among the ice cliffs, and as
the Ranger dashed up to one of them the cyclone was only a
short distance astern of her.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Take that narrow gorge,” cried Frank.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Shure, it may not go in all ther way,” expostulated
Barney.</p>

<p class='c000'>“True; but it will afford us most protection.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Jist as you say, me bye.”</p>

<p class='c000'>And into it dashed the ice boat like lightning.</p>

<p class='c000'>The pass was winding, and the bottom lumpy, and Barney
grasped the levers with one hand.</p>

<p class='c000'>All the rest went out to haul down the sails.</p>

<p class='c000'>Around a curve swept the Ranger, as the canvas fluttered
down, and Barney gave utterance to a startled exclamation,
and hastily cut out the current, for the pass terminated in
a cul-de-sac.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>The ice ship was plunging with fearful velocity straight
at the wall that rose to an immense height in front of her.</p>

<p class='c000'>It seemed for a moment to Barney that she must run
her long bowsprit against the hard wall.</p>

<p class='c000'>Such a collision would probably smash her to pieces.</p>

<p class='c000'>He rapidly lowered the side wheels.</p>

<p class='c000'>Putting on the current, he reversed the wheels, and they
tore through the ice with a terrific ripping sound.</p>

<p class='c000'>The boat did not pause at once.</p>

<p class='c000'>She slid along a considerable distance, her wheels ripping
up the ice and sending it flying in two streams on each side
of her.</p>

<p class='c000'>Barney was frightened.</p>

<p class='c000'>Then came a bang as the bowsprit struck.</p>

<p class='c000'>But the shock was not heavy enough to break it.</p>

<p class='c000'>The pole had run into a crevice, and there it was jammed.</p>

<p class='c000'>Flung down by the collision, every one thought for a few
moments that some serious injury had been done to the
ship.</p>

<p class='c000'>In this belief they were undeceived, as soon as they got
upon their feet and saw how she struck.</p>

<p class='c000'>The cyclone had by this time hit the cliffs.</p>

<p class='c000'>Huge fragments of ice were torn off and hurled in the
air, and a shower of splintered particles rained down in the
ravine.</p>

<p class='c000'>They drove Frank and his companions inside.</p>

<p class='c000'>Further retreat was cut off by the dead wall, and the
boat could not move any way on account of the bowsprit
being caught.</p>

<p class='c000'>All they could do was to wait.</p>

<p class='c000'>The storm cloud raged fiercely about the cliffs.</p>

<p class='c000'>It seemed to make an effort to tear them to pieces.</p>

<p class='c000'>In this design it met with some success, but it finally
passed on, leaving a broad trail of devastation behind, and
sending enormous blocks of ice thundering down from the
cliff tops.</p>

<p class='c000'>Once it had passed ahead, Frank and his companions
broke the ice away from around the bowsprit with axes, and
released her.</p>

<p class='c000'>She was then turned around.</p>

<p class='c000'>Going aboard, they ran her back for the entrance to the
ravine to get out on the icy plain again.</p>

<p class='c000'>But when they reached the place where the opening had
been, they found it blocked up by tons of the ice that had
fallen down from the cliff tops.</p>

<p class='c000'>The ice ship could not get out.</p>

<p class='c000'>Every one was alarmed by this, for the ice blocks were so
high and thick that they saw no possible means of getting
the ship over it, for the top of the gorge was too contracted
to allow her to fly up and thus pass the barrier.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='X' class='c009'>CHAPTER X.<br /> <span class='large'>PLUNGED IN A LAKE.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c012'>A conference was held by the four adventurers to devise
a means of overcoming the icy barrier choking up the exit
of the ravine, and finally Frank said:</p>

<p class='c000'>“The only way I can see out of the difficulty is to melt
it.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“How yo’ gwine ter do dat?” asked Pomp, in perplexity.</p>

<p class='c000'>“By means of electric heat,” promptly answered Frank.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Faix, it’s a puzzle yer givin’ us intoirely,” said Barney.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I’ll explain. By forming a wire net over the ice and
charging it with all the heat we use for the boat, the ice
can gradually be melted away enough to let us get through.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Such a plan will consume much time,” said Dr. Vaneyke,
“but as no better solution of the problem can be advanced,
let us try it.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“By de time we done reach Nordenskjold bay,” said
Pomp, “de Red Eric mebbe be gone away.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I hope not,” Frank said.</p>

<p class='c000'>They saw no more of the cyclone that drove them into the
pass, and set to work to carry out his idea.</p>

<p class='c000'>The days were now so short that most of the work was
done by moonlight.</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank’s plan operated, but it took a long time to melt
the icy barrier, and deprived of the heat, the interior of
the Ranger became cold and cheerless.</p>

<p class='c000'>A day and a night passed before they finally got the ice
ship out on the icy plain again, and resumed their journey
over the ground toward the place where the whaler was in
winter quarters.</p>

<p class='c000'>The question that most troubled them was whether Ben
Bolt had the shanghaied boy aboard his ship yet.</p>

<p class='c000'>They did not know that he had contracted with Alfred
Milburn to put Walter Grey out of the way, so the lawyer
could gain possession of the boy’s fortune.</p>

<p class='c000'>Nor did Bolt know that the lawyer was in prison, Mrs.
Grey in possession of her husband’s fortune, and Frank on
his track to rescue the boy.</p>

<p class='c000'>The mammoth’s bones did not interfere with the Ranger’s
work, whether she was in the sea, on the ice, or in the
air, as she was calculated to carry a much greater weight.</p>

<p class='c000'>Barney and Pomp were so delighted over their escape
from the pass that they got out the fiddle and the banjo
and struck up a lively melody as the ice ship sped along.</p>

<p class='c000'>The cyclone had left a broad trail where it swept over the
ice, tumbling great blocks here and there, sending the loose
<span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>snow up in great drifts and sweeping the ice perfectly clean.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Had the Ranger been caught in its grip,” said Frank,
“there would by this time have been nothing left of her.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Then it’s lucky we ran into that cul-de-sac,” answered
Vaneyke.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Now to locate Nordenskjold Bay.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“It’s on the northwest coast, ain’t it?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yes,” answered Frank.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Why did Ben Bolt go there?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Very likely to avoid the whalers in the strait.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“You think he must have had an object in so doing?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“It is my impression that he yet has the shanghaied boy
on his craft, and did not want the other whalers to know it.
In a lonely, desolate place like the bay is where the Red
Eric lies, he can put the unlucky boy out of the way, and no
one will be the wiser. Don’t you see the point?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“That’s just what I thought, Frank.”</p>

<p class='c000'>At this moment a fine big reindeer bounded into view
from behind a mass of icy blocks.</p>

<p class='c000'>The beast cast a frightened glance of its big soft eyes at
the boat, and wheeling around, it sped away.</p>

<p class='c000'>“There’s fine game!” ejaculated Frank.</p>

<p class='c000'>“For those who can catch it.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I think we could drop him.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“With a rifle?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yes; if I can get in range.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Try it.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“You take the wheel.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The professor grasped the spokes, put on more speed,
and Frank took a rifle and went out on deck.</p>

<p class='c000'>The deer was speeding over the ice like the wind, and the
ice boat rushed after it furiously.</p>

<p class='c000'>A loud buzz arose from the wheels and a crackling from
under the big steel runners.</p>

<p class='c000'>Fast as the deer was going, the animal was no match for
the ice ship, and it gradually bore down upon the creature.</p>

<p class='c000'>“The deer is going in a long curve,” said the doctor.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Can’t you cut across the curve and head it off?” asked
Frank.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yes. That will bring us nearer the sea coast.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Go ahead, then. I want to get in range.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The deer was heading for the coast; but, for some reason,
was describing a sort of semi-circle.</p>

<p class='c000'>Dr. Vaneyke, instead of steering along in the animal’s
tracks, now took a short cut with the boat.</p>

<p class='c000'>Only half the distance to the shore was covered when
Frank raised his rifle and fired.</p>

<p class='c000'>The deer bounded up in the air and fell dead.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Hurrah! You’ve dropped him!” cried the professor.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Cut across toward him, doctor.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Vaneyke was about to carry out this order when the ice
suddenly began to crack and snap under the boat like a volley
of artillery.</p>

<p class='c000'>Then it broke in.</p>

<p class='c000'>Down sank the Ranger in the midst of the smashing
ice, and a tremendous upheaval of the water.</p>

<p class='c000'>There was a lake beneath the thin ice which emptied into
the sea.</p>

<p class='c000'>She had gone into this.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was low tide, and much of the water had run out from
under the sheet of ice, so that when the boat broke through
she went down five feet before she touched the water.</p>

<p class='c000'>The ice over a large area had split and caved in all
around the Ranger.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was to go around the lake that the deer had been going
in a circle was now very evident.</p>

<p class='c000'>A cake of the ice struck Frank a violent blow and knocked
him overboard into the freezing water.</p>

<p class='c000'>Scarcely had he landed in the brine when down came
the ice upon his head, and he was buried out of sight.</p>

<p class='c000'>Pushed under the water, he sank to a considerable depth.</p>

<p class='c000'>When he arose his head was under the ice.</p>

<p class='c000'>It held him under the water so he could not breathe.</p>

<p class='c000'>For an instant Frank was so bewildered that he felt sure
he was going to drown; then he pulled his faculties together,
and realizing his position, he dove under and swam under
water.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was lucky for him that he went in the right direction,
for he came up in clear water beside the boat.</p>

<p class='c000'>Had he not done so he certainly would have drowned.</p>

<p class='c000'>Grasping one of the runners, he held himself up until he
got his breath, and then climbed to the deck.</p>

<p class='c000'>No one knew what had befallen him until he went inside
the turret, where he found Barney and Pomp with the doctor.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Good Heaven! what does this mean?” asked the latter.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Knocked overboard by a cake of ice.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Lord amassy, chile, why didn’ yo’ yell?” asked Pomp.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I scarcely had time to even breathe.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yer’d better change yer clothes an’ take a sup o’ whiskey,”
advised Barney; “or, be heavens! it’s a cowld in yer
head yez will catch.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank laughed and dove down-stairs.</p>

<p class='c000'>When he returned in a change of clothing, he showed no
ill effects from his involuntary cold bath.</p>

<p class='c000'>He found his companions devising a means of getting out
of the trap into which the deer had lured them.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>“The only way to do is to start the gyroscopes revolving,”
said Frank. “Let her land near the dead deer.”</p>

<p class='c000'>This plan was carried out.</p>

<p class='c000'>The boat landed on solid ice again.</p>

<p class='c000'>As soon as the ice ship landed beside the carcase of the
deer Frank went around and secured the best portions of it.</p>

<p class='c000'>Then they resumed their journey to the northward.</p>

<p class='c000'>Numerous indentations were met with along the coast,
and a keen lookout was kept for the whaler.</p>

<p class='c000'>As they proceeded the ice grew rougher.</p>

<p class='c000'>Mighty cliffs rose here and there, vast glaciers were
crossed, valleys were traversed, and they had to skirt the
bases of huge rocky ridges and towering mountains.</p>

<p class='c000'>Everything presented a wild and picturesque appearance,
perfectly desolate as far as humanity was concerned, and
yet teeming with birds and beasts.</p>

<p class='c000'>How these creatures subsisted in that barren region was
a mystery; but it was clear that they gained a very meager
living, as was evidenced by their gaunt, bony forms.</p>

<p class='c000'>League after league was passed over.</p>

<p class='c000'>Finally Frank made a calculation, and referring to a
chart, he said to his friends in the cabin:</p>

<p class='c000'>“We must be very close to Nordenskjold bay now.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Faix, it’s no soign av a bay have I seen in some toime.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Neither have I,” said the doctor.</p>

<p class='c000'>“But the distance traveled warrants the belief that we
are near it,” persisted Frank.</p>

<p class='c000'>Barney was just about to reply when there came a yell
from Pomp, up in the turret.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Dar’s a anchored ship now!”</p>

<p class='c000'>Every one was startled.</p>

<p class='c000'>They rushed up-stairs.</p>

<p class='c000'>Off to the right they saw the vessel.</p>

<p class='c000'>As soon as Frank saw her he cried:</p>

<p class='c000'>“It is the Red Eric!”</p>

<p class='c000'>The whaler, stripped of her canvas, was moored to the
shore of a large bay in a great basin below an eminence
upon which the ice ship had just come to a pause.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='XI' class='c009'>CHAPTER XI.<br /> <span class='large'>BEARDING THE LION IN HIS DEN.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c012'>The appearance of Captain Ben Bolt’s ship so close by
sent a thrill through the crew of the Ranger.</p>

<p class='c000'>Not a soul was to be seen upon the whaler, and Frank
at once caused the ice ship to recoil out of sight.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Well,” said Dr. Vaneyke, “there is the ship we are after.
Now what, do you intend to do about it, Frank?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“First ascertain if Walter Grey is aboard of her.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“How will you go about it?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I’m going down alone to investigate.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“That’s a dangerous piece of business.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Very true, sir; but I am not afraid to venture.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Well, we will keep a sharp watch upon your movements
from up here, and if we see that you need our assistance,
all hands will be ready to go down to your aid.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“That suits me.”</p>

<p class='c000'>And so saying, Frank armed himself with a brace of
pneumatic pistols and a knife, and leaving the Ranger, he
strode away.</p>

<p class='c000'>At some distance from the boat, he observed a cleft in the
ice, down which he could go to the shore of the bay.</p>

<p class='c000'>The water in which the whaler floated was open in the
middle, but the shores were frozen up, excepting for a
stretch that extended outward from where the boat laid.</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank made his way down to the shore.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was then quite dark.</p>

<p class='c000'>The young inventor started toward the ship.</p>

<p class='c000'>He did not see any one upon her.</p>

<p class='c000'>But there was a man’s face pressed against a parted
curtain at one of the bull’s-eyes in the stern.</p>

<p class='c000'>He was intently watching the inventor.</p>

<p class='c000'>This individual was Ben Bolt.</p>

<p class='c000'>He was astonished to see Frank, but did not recognize
him in the fur costume he wore, for the hood covered most
of the young man’s face to ward off the cold.</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank walked from one end of the boat to the other.</p>

<p class='c000'>Finding a ladder at the side, he made his way up to the
deserted ice-covered deck and saw a light in the cabin windows.</p>

<p class='c000'>From down in the forecastle came the sound of sailors’
voices, and a stream of smoke was pouring up from a funnel
in the deck, showing that the whalers had fires going below
decks.</p>

<p class='c000'>He had scarcely observed this when the cabin door was
opened.</p>

<p class='c000'>The captain strode out, muffled up in heavy clothing.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Hello, thar!” he exclaimed.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Hello yourself!” replied Frank.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Whar d’you hail from?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“My ship, in another section.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“What craft is that?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“The Ranger.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Whaler?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“No; an exploring boat.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Oh, I see. Won’t you come inside?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I don’t mind. It’s bitterly cold out here.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The captain led the way into his cabin, and Frank followed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>him, closing and locking the door, and taking the
key.</p>

<p class='c000'>Not another man was in the cozy little room.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Sit down,” said Bolt, pointing to a chair beside the
table.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Thank you,” replied Frank, complying, and Bolt seated
himself opposite.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Now give us an account of yourself.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Well,” replied Frank, “I’m searching for a certain
party.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Shipwrecked crew?” queried the captain, curiously.</p>

<p class='c000'>“No,” replied Frank, fixing a keen glance on the man,
“A stolen boy.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“What!” roared Bolt, with a sudden start.</p>

<p class='c000'>“A boy who was shanghaied.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“The deuce!” gasped the captain, excitedly.</p>

<p class='c000'>“His name is Walter Grey.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“By thunder!” roared Bolt, turning pale.</p>

<p class='c000'>“And he was carried off on this ship from Boston.”</p>

<p class='c000'>With a wild glare in his eyes, the captain regarded Frank
as if he were some horrible apparition.</p>

<p class='c000'>“That voice!” he muttered, rising.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Do you recognize me?” asked the inventor, uncovering
his face.</p>

<p class='c000'>A yell of alarm escaped the captain when he saw who his
caller was, and he recoiled a step, exclaiming:</p>

<p class='c000'>“Ther feller wot I shot!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yes,” assented Frank, as he whipped out a pistol and
covered the wretch with it; “and if you utter a word to betray
me to your crew, I’ll put a ball in your brain.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“For God’s sake, don’t shoot!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Fall on your knees!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yes, yes!” said Bolt, and down he went.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Now lie on your face!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I won’t!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Quick!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yes, yes!”</p>

<p class='c000'>And down he went.</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank smiled and glanced around.</p>

<p class='c000'>There were plenty things to tie him with.</p>

<p class='c000'>The inventor secured a long, stout lanyard.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Place your hands behind your back!” he ordered.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Don’t kill me!” whined the captain, as he obeyed.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I won’t, if you behave. I’ll simply render you helpless
so you can’t show any treachery.”</p>

<p class='c000'>And Frank bound the captain’s arms behind his back.</p>

<p class='c000'>Bolt was then allowed to sit up.</p>

<p class='c000'>He was pale and agitated beyond all measure.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Now, see here, my man!” said Frank, sternly, “I’ve
chased you all the way here from Boston to rescue Walter
Grey——”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I don’t know nothin’ about him,” growled Bolt.</p>

<p class='c000'>“That’s an infamous lie, for I saw Alfred Milburn carry
him aboard of this ship when you and your two men were
at me. Before I left Boston Mrs. Grey was out of the lunatic
asylum and Milburn was forced to disgorge her fortune.
He is now in prison for what he did.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The feelings of Ben Bolt upon hearing this were indescribable.</p>

<p class='c000'>He realized that the plot had been exposed which made
him liable for complicity, and reasoned at once that he had
lost all chance of getting the extra $2,500 Milburn offered
to pay him for putting the boy out of the way.</p>

<p class='c000'>Indeed, he now stood a good chance to go to prison for
what he had done in the matter.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Ther game’s up!” he groaned.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yes,” assented Frank. “All the lies you utter now
will not avail you in the least. If I like I can take you away
and put you in jail. But I will be easy with you.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yes, yes!” eagerly said the captain.</p>

<p class='c000'>“But only under one condition.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“What is it?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“You must give up the boy.”</p>

<p class='c000'>A look of despair crossed the captain’s face.</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank saw the expression, and began to feel uneasy.</p>

<p class='c000'>He waited a few moments, and as the captain said nothing,
he cried:</p>

<p class='c000'>“Well, well! Why don’t you answer?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I can’t do wot yer want.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Why not?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“‘Cause I ain’t got ther lad.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“You haven’t?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“No.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Where is he?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Sent adrift.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Explain yourself.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yesterday this craft was on ther sea. A quarter boat
wuz towin’ astarn, ther boy in it, a-paintin’ ther ship.
Ther rope must ha’ broke, leavin’ him adrift on ther sea,
‘cause we found ther end of ther broken painter, an’ missed
ther quarter boat.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank eyed him searchingly.</p>

<p class='c000'>He was a good reader of character, and realized that Ben
Bolt was telling the truth about the matter.</p>

<p class='c000'>“What time yesterday did this occur?” he asked.</p>

<p class='c000'>“In ther afternoon, about three o’clock.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Where was this ship?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Two leagues from land, off the mouth of this bay.”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>“What doing?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Huntin’ for a whale one of ther men seen.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“That settles it. I’m going to look for that boy. If I
find that you have committed any crime in this case, I shall
run you down and put you in jail.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The captain was silent.</p>

<p class='c000'>He had secretly cut the painter, leaving the boy adrift.</p>

<p class='c000'>But this he of course kept to himself.</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank unlocked the door and flung it open, when the
captain caught sight of some of his men on deck.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Help! Help!” he yelled.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Shut up!” exclaimed Frank.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Shoot that fellow! He tried to kill me!” proceeded
Bolt.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Villain!” cried the inventor, angrily.</p>

<p class='c000'>He saw the men rushing aft, and not to get caught in a
trap, he hastened out upon deck.</p>

<p class='c000'>One of the men had a pistol, and seeing Frank, fired at
him.</p>

<p class='c000'>The ball chipped a piece out of the side of his jacket, and
he at once shot the man down.</p>

<p class='c000'>A yell arose from the others, and they ran up forward.</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank rushed to the side and hastened down the ladder.</p>

<p class='c000'>No sooner had he reached the ground than the rest of the
crow came tumbling up from below.</p>

<p class='c000'>The inventor saw that an encounter with the whole crew
would be a very serious matter.</p>

<p class='c000'>He therefore started to run away, when they all came
swarming over the ice after him.</p>

<p class='c000'>With loud cries of hostility they started off in pursuit of
Frank.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='XII' class='c009'>CHAPTER XII.<br /> <span class='large'>THE BOY AND THE WOLVES.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c012'>“Frank! Frank!”</p>

<p class='c000'>This cry startled the inventor.</p>

<p class='c000'>He glanced up and saw the ice ship launch itself into the
air and come sailing toward him.</p>

<p class='c000'>Vaneyke was in the turret, and it was he who shouted.</p>

<p class='c000'>The professor darted the searchlight down into the
eyes of the whalers, bringing them to a pause.</p>

<p class='c000'>Barney had gone out on deck with a rope.</p>

<p class='c000'>One end was tied to the rail, and the other was dangling
down.</p>

<p class='c000'>As the boat swept over him, Frank grasped the noose in
the end of the line, and shouted cheerily:</p>

<p class='c000'>“I’ve got it!”</p>

<p class='c000'>Up went the Ranger the next moment.</p>

<p class='c000'>To the astonishment of the pursuers Frank was whirled
up into the air over their heads, and before they could recover
from their surprise he was far beyond their reach.</p>

<p class='c000'>Pomp now rushed out upon deck.</p>

<p class='c000'>Assisting Barney, they pulled Frank up.</p>

<p class='c000'>As soon as he reached the deck he thanked his friends
for their timely assistance and going into the turret with
them he explained what Ben Bolt confessed to him.</p>

<p class='c000'>“The case looks hopeless now,” said the professor.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I don’t agree with you,” said Frank.</p>

<p class='c000'>“How can you expect to find the boy?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“By searching, of course. You must remember that the
Gulf Stream sweeps along this shore. It would carry the
quarter boat along with it. We must follow its course.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Are yez shure ther captain didn’t lie?” asked Barney.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I noticed that one of the quarter boats was missing.
That fact seems to bear out what he asserted.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“But mebbe the boy got asho’,” suggested Pomp.</p>

<p class='c000'>“He might,” Frank admitted; “but if the boat was towing,
she would not be apt to have oars in her by means of
which Grey could row her.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Why don’t you think so?” asked the professor.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Because,” replied Frank, significantly, “if it was to the
financial interest of Ben Bolt to have the boat break loose
he would have taken mighty great pains to see that no oars
were in the boat.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Den yo’ fink de boat wuz bruk loose apuppose, honey?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Most decidedly I do. I can see the hand of Captain
Ben Bolt in that rascally deed most plainly.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“How shall I steer the Ranger?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Up the coast, doctor.”</p>

<p class='c000'>They left the Red Eric out of sight astern in the gloom,
and were soon flying over the sea close to the shore.</p>

<p class='c000'>The rays of the searchlight were bent down.</p>

<p class='c000'>Sweeping the coast and sea continually as the boat was
lowered, there was not much chance of an object so large
as a quarter boat being missed by its broad glare of light.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Ranger hovered but one hundred feet above the sea.</p>

<p class='c000'>She went along very slowly.</p>

<p class='c000'>To the left lay a great patch of clear, open water, in
which no ice could stay without melting.</p>

<p class='c000'>This was the northern arm of the Gulf Stream.</p>

<p class='c000'>Supper was served.</p>

<p class='c000'>Our friends now kept watch two by two.</p>

<p class='c000'>Outside it was frightfully cold, for the thermometer
mercury had fallen to thirty-five degrees below zero.</p>

<p class='c000'>The air was fogged around the boat by clouds of fine
needles of ice, through which the moonlight shone, making
the sky gleam and glisten like polished silver.</p>

<p class='c000'>To go out in this frozen moisture of air, leaving any
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>part of the body exposed, meant frost bites of the severest
kinds, as our friends knew by experience.</p>

<p class='c000'>The night passed wearily away.</p>

<p class='c000'>When day came, no sunlight appeared until eleven
o’clock.</p>

<p class='c000'>Even then it only lasted three hours.</p>

<p class='c000'>“It hardly seems probable that the boat could have
landed here,” said Frank. “That shore ice would keep it
away.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“There’s more likelihood of it having been crushed by the
floating ice cakes,” replied the professor.</p>

<p class='c000'>Just then Barney came in from the deck.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Shtop her!” he exclaimed.</p>

<p class='c000'>“What for?” demanded Frank.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Shure, I see ther quarter boat.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“You do? Where?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“We’ve passed it.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank lowered the Ranger, turned her around, and flung
the light ahead at a spot indicated by the Irishman.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was a heap of pack ice on the frozen coast.</p>

<p class='c000'>Jammed in among the ice was a boat.</p>

<p class='c000'>The position of the boat, half buried under the shelving
ice, was such that it was almost hidden from view.</p>

<p class='c000'>“No wonder we missed it,” said Frank.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Faix, I’d a misht it meself,” replied Barney, “only I
had a telescope in me fisht, so I did.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The Ranger was brought to a pause above the boat a few
yards, they saw that it was empty.</p>

<p class='c000'>It contained no oars.</p>

<p class='c000'>At the bow was a painter with a frayed end.</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank eyed the ice with a glass, and saw a mantle of snow
on it.</p>

<p class='c000'>Presently he gave utterance to an exclamation.</p>

<p class='c000'>“By jingo! A trail!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“What?” eagerly asked Dr. Vaneyke.</p>

<p class='c000'>“There’s a track of human footprints in the snow on
the ice that run in toward the coast yonder.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Made by Walter Grey?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“The marks are small, evidently those of a boy’s feet.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Frank, I think we will find him now.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I hope so, professor. Anyway, we’ll follow the tracks.”</p>

<p class='c000'>He kept the flying machine within a few yards of the ice,
and sent her slowly along inland toward some steep cliffs.</p>

<p class='c000'>The enormous precipices towered up a thousand feet in
the air, and formed the base of a tremendous mountain,
which stood on the verge of the sea.</p>

<p class='c000'>Along went the Ranger, and she presently drew close to
the base of the cliffs.</p>

<p class='c000'>Here a big beach was seen.</p>

<p class='c000'>It looked as if it were the bed of a great mountain torrent.</p>

<p class='c000'>The well-defined trail passed into this place, and the
Ranger followed it up into the gloomy defile.</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank had to raise the boat every few moments, as the
path sloped at an acute angle.</p>

<p class='c000'>After awhile they reached a level plateau at the top of
the cliffs and observed that the trail ran to the left.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Ranger still pursued it.</p>

<p class='c000'>“How fortunate that no wind or snow storm occurred
here since these tracks were made,” commented Frank.
“Had it occurred the trail would have been eliminated.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Wha’ de deuce dat chile gwine up heah fo’?” asked
Pomp.</p>

<p class='c000'>“He must have had some purpose in view for doing it.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Begorra, there’s no ind to ther spalpeen’s walkin’,” said
the Irishman. “It’s off we’ll foind his legs when we roon
across him.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Hark! What’s that?” interposed Frank.</p>

<p class='c000'>They all listened.</p>

<p class='c000'>For awhile deep silence ensued.</p>

<p class='c000'>Then they heard a faint, distant cry.</p>

<p class='c000'>It came from the direction they followed.</p>

<p class='c000'>And it was in a human voice, too.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Some one in distress,” said the professor.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Wha dem yudder voices?” asked the coon.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Wolves!” cried Frank after a pause.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Faith, it’s afther ther lad they must be!” cried Barney.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I’ll hurry the boat along,” said Frank.</p>

<p class='c000'>But just as he was about to do she sank to the ground,
her gyroscopes having almost stopped whirling.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Heavens! What’s this?” gasped Vaneyke.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Something must have happened to the dynamo.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I’se gwine down fo’ to see.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“We can use the batteries on the runner wheels yet!”
cried Frank.</p>

<p class='c000'>He started them going and followed the trail easier now.</p>

<p class='c000'>At the same moment he heard a terrible noise up the
mountain and saw an enormous snow slide coming down
the side toward them.</p>

<p class='c000'>Once this mass of tons upon tons of snow fell on them,
the ice ship would be buried.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Ranger was now rushing ahead again down a steep
declivity that terminated at the edge of the lofty cliffs.</p>

<p class='c000'>Ahead Frank now saw a boyish figure in the midst of a
pack of ravenous wolves.</p>

<p class='c000'>He was armed with a revolver, with which he was firing
into them, while he shrieked to frighten them away.</p>

<p class='c000'>Up to him rushed the ice ship.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>Barney ran out on deck, and stood at the side of the boat
to render the boy aid.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Pomp!” screamed Frank, “is the dynamo fixed?”
“Yassah!” came the reply. “Only a wire got unfastened.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“There’s a wall ahead. We can’t go much further this
way, Frank.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I’ll have to go over the edge of the cliff, then, doctor.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Good heavens!”</p>

<p class='c000'>Into the pack of wolves rushed the boat, scattering the
howling beasts right and left, and a scream of joy burst
from the boy’s lips when he saw her coming.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='XIII' class='c009'>CHAPTER XIII.<br /> <span class='large'>OFF THE CLIFF.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c012'>“Shtop ther Ranger—quick!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“All right, Barney.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Give us yer hand, me bye.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Here you are, sir.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“All roight, Frank, go ahead. I’ve got him.”</p>

<p class='c000'>And up on the deck Barney hoisted the boy in a twinkling.</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank looked up and saw the avalanche of snow almost
upon them and then glanced ahead.</p>

<p class='c000'>Many mighty ice blocks obstructed the Ranger’s path,
and as she could not turn around and retrace her course,
Frank resolved to try a desperate plan.</p>

<p class='c000'>He determined to rush off the top of the cliff.</p>

<p class='c000'>Accordingly he spun the wheel around and the boat
dashed like lightning to the edge of the precipice.</p>

<p class='c000'>As quick as a flash he pulled the gyroscope lever.</p>

<p class='c000'>To his horror the wheels did not lift the boat at once.</p>

<p class='c000'>Were they madly dashing to their doom?</p>

<p class='c000'>Death seemed certain if they went off the cliff, but it was
too late to do anything else now, as he could not stop her,
nor had he room to swerve her aside.</p>

<p class='c000'>A cold sweat burst out all over him.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Heavens!” he gasped. “Pomp told me the dynamo was
fixed.”</p>

<p class='c000'>A shout of intense horror escaped Frank’s companions,
and as the boat leaped like a cannon-ball from that appalling
height, every one instinctively grasped something to
hold himself.</p>

<p class='c000'>Far out from the cliff shot the Ranger.</p>

<p class='c000'>She was closely pursued by the avalanche.</p>

<p class='c000'>Every one gave a gasp as the boat began to fall.</p>

<p class='c000'>But when they observed that she went down very slowly,
they realized that they were not doomed yet.</p>

<p class='c000'>Indeed the gyroscopes had been revolving from the moment
Frank first turned on the lever; but as it required a
few seconds for the current to get them spinning fast
enough to buoy the ship up, they had not sustained the
Ranger immediately.</p>

<p class='c000'>As soon as the ice boat gained its equilibrium in the air,
however, she came to a pause and hung there.</p>

<p class='c000'>The avalanche of snow poured over the cliff and fell with
a dull roar down upon the ice below.</p>

<p class='c000'>“God bless me sowl!” said Barney. “We’re floyin’!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Is this the end of us?” asked a trembling voice beside
him.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was the boy who spoke, and he gazed around shudderingly,
for he thought they were going to drop to the earth.</p>

<p class='c000'>He was the same boy whom Frank had made an effort to
defend in Boston, and he wore the same natty cap and military
school uniform beneath a rough coat much too big for
him.</p>

<p class='c000'>His wan, pale face bore the stamp of great suffering, too.</p>

<p class='c000'>Barney shook his head and replied:</p>

<p class='c000'>“We’re safe! Shure, this is a flyin’ machine.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Oh—I see!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Come inside, me bye.”</p>

<p class='c000'>He led Walter Grey into the turret.</p>

<p class='c000'>The poor fellow was half frozen.</p>

<p class='c000'>Our friends warmed him up, fed him, put fur clothing on
him, and finally told him all about what had happened in
Boston, and their subsequent search for him.</p>

<p class='c000'>He was amazed at the story.</p>

<p class='c000'>When it was finished, he said:</p>

<p class='c000'>“I had a hard time of it aboard the Red Eric when I revived
from the drug. Bolt made me work with the crew.
There I got nothing but kicks and cuffs, poor fare and hard
work. At the time they were looking for the whale I was
towing astern mixing paint in a quarter boat. Ben Bolt
appeared at the taffrail and cut the painter. I was left
adrift. No attention was paid to my cries. The current
carried me to where you found the boat. Thinking I
might find some one on shore, I went up on the cliffs. A
pack of wolves attacked me. I had a pistol which I found
aboard the Red Eric, but it did little good. If you hadn’t
arrived just in time, the beasts would have killed me.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Then Captain Ben Bolt deliberately cut you adrift?”
asked Frank.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yes. More—he said, as he did it, ‘I’ve been waiting for
this chance to put you out of the way, I won’t let it slip!’
That showed me that he thirsted for my life.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I’ll make him answer for his evil work!” declared
Frank.</p>

<p class='c000'>“How do you mean, Mr. Reade?”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>“Why, I’ll make a prisoner of him, carry him back to
Boston, and put him in prison for his wickedness.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Do you know where to find him?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Why, yes; in Nordenskjold bay.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Don’t you think he will leave there after what happened?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Probably; but he can’t escape me, though.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The flying ice ship was steered down the coast again.</p>

<p class='c000'>When she reached the bay, Frank found the ship gone.</p>

<p class='c000'>“She certainly did not go northward,” said the inventor
to his friends. “We would have seen her if she had. Therefore
we must go to the southward to find her.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Perhaps she has gone to the strait.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“That’s the only open place in which she could find a
safe refuge,” said Frank. “We return to the Norwegian
fishing station.”</p>

<p class='c000'>According to this plan, they continued on to the southward.</p>

<p class='c000'>On the following morning the doctor was at the wheel,
and Barney went on deck to examine the shore with a glass.</p>

<p class='c000'>Warmly clothed as the Irishman was, he shivered, for
the moisture over the Gulf Stream was very dense, and congealed
into those fine, penetrating particles in greater profusion
here than elsewhere.</p>

<p class='c000'>They seemed to fairly go through his furs.</p>

<p class='c000'>His eyes were protected by goggles, and he had drawn
on a pair of fur overshoes, which were strapped to his legs.</p>

<p class='c000'>Pomp had assisted him to put those pattens on with a
most suspicious kind of zeal, which Barney failed to observe.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Irishman stood at the stern for a few minutes watching
the shore with his glass; then he attempted to return to
the interior.</p>

<p class='c000'>He could not budge an inch.</p>

<p class='c000'>A look of surprise overspread his face.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Begob, I’m shtuck!” he gasped.</p>

<p class='c000'>Then he made a second effort to walk away.</p>

<p class='c000'>It proved to be as futile as the first, and the expression of
perplexity upon his face deepened into one of blank dismay.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Howly jim-jams!” he ejaculated. “Me legs is that
numb I’ve lost control av thim intoirely.”</p>

<p class='c000'>He struggled frantically to move, but fell on his back,
the soles of his fur shoes glued to the deck tenaciously.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Murdher!” he howled, “I’m a goner. Hey, Pomp!
Hey, Pomp!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Wha’ yo? wan’, honey?” responded the coon, rushing
out of the turret with a broad grin on his ebony face.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Send for a lawyer till I make me will. I’m a corpse!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Wha’ de matter?” chuckled Pomp, grinning harder
than ever behind his face protector.</p>

<p class='c000'>“D’yez yer moind ther legs av me?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Dey’s long enough.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“It’s paralyzed they are. I’m dyin’ from me toes upards.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Why doan’ yer git up?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I can’t. All power have left me intoirely.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I’se gwine ter see ‘bout dat,” said Pomp.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Howld yer gob!” roared Barney, angrily. “Is it laughin’
yez are at a dead man? Be heavens, I’ll bate yez black
an’ blue!”</p>

<p class='c000'>And he gave Pomp a thump in the neck that made him
see stars.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Glory to de lamb!” roared the coon. “Wha’ fo’ yo’
soak me dat way, yo’ ole scallawag—h’m?”</p>

<p class='c000'>And so saying he rushed up at Barney, grabbed him by
the nose with a vise-like grip, and gave that organ such a
twist that Barney roared and clinched him.</p>

<p class='c000'>For a few moments they struggled, but as Barney could
not move his feet, the coon had the best of it.</p>

<p class='c000'>He was just going to pull Barney’s hair when Frank
came out on deck and shouted wrathfully at them.</p>

<p class='c000'>Up jumped Pomp and inside he rushed to escape a
scolding which Frank now poured out at the Irishman.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Didn’t I send you out here to look for the strait?” he
asked.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yis, sor,” groaned Barney.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Get up from there.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yis, sor,” and the Celt complied.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Come here!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I can’t!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Why can’t you?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Me legs rafuses ter boodge, sor.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank saw that he could not move, and walking over to
the Irishman, he knelt down and examined his shoes.</p>

<p class='c000'>He quickly detected the cause of Barney’s plight.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Did you soak the soles of your fur boots in hot water
before you came out in this freezing temperature?” he
asked.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Why, no, sor,” replied Barney, in astonishment.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Well, they’ve been treated that way, and are frozen fast
to the deck.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Arrah, it wuz koind ther naygur wuz ter help me on wid
‘em,” said Barney. “Av coorse he didn’t do it, but if yez
will onstharp thim fer me, I’ll folly that coon an’ bate ther
flure wid his liver.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Up to his jokes again,” sighed Frank, as he released the
Irishman. “But let it pass, Barney, for there’s the strait
<span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>now, and we’ll have to spend our time looking for the
whaler instead of playing practical jokes.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Begorra, ye’ve saved ther loife av ther coon,” said Barney,
as he left his fur soles stuck fast to the deck and hastened
inside after Frank out of the cold.</p>

<p class='c000'>The doctor had turned the ice ship to the leeward.</p>

<p class='c000'>She sped along inland over the strait, and in a couple of
hours reached the Norwegian fishing station.</p>

<p class='c000'>As Frank glanced down he saw four ships.</p>

<p class='c000'>They were the three he had seen there before and the Red
Eric as well.</p>

<div class='chapter'>

</div>

<p class='c012'>The whalers who had made their quarters at the settlement
saw the air ship almost as soon as our friends saw
their vessels, for the searchlight of the Ranger was brightly
blazing.</p>

<p class='c000'>All hands surrounded the flying machine as soon as she
landed, and one of the captains pressed forward and cried:</p>

<p class='c000'>“We’ve captured the whole crew of the Red Eric for you,
and searched their craft, but hang me if we can find the boy
aboard!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“For the very good reason that I’ve got him,” answered
Frank.</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank called the boy out, and while standing at the side
of the Ranger, Walter told the whalers his pitiful story.</p>

<p class='c000'>It incensed them against Captain Bolt, and by the time
the boy had finished his recital, many a threat was muttered
against the rascally captain.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Let’s hang the villain at the yardarm of his craft!”
said one.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Don’t use violence,” remonstrated Frank.</p>

<p class='c000'>“You’ll put him through the courts?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Such is my intention. I owe the rascal a debt of
vengeance for once having shot me, and on another occasion
inciting his men to try to murder me.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Well, your plan’s a good one. We’ll put him in your
hands?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“How about his ship?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“The first mate’s a good man, and can manage her.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Bring him to me, then, and I’ll lock him up aboard
here.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Several of the sailors were dispatched aboard the Red
Eric in a boat.</p>

<p class='c000'>When they returned, they not only had the captain with
them, but he was shackled hand and foot.</p>

<p class='c000'>He cast a baleful glance at Walter Grey when he saw him
with Frank’s party, and snarled, in ugly tones:</p>

<p class='c000'>“So they’ve found ye, hey?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yes; and you know what to expect now,” said the boy.</p>

<p class='c000'>“What kin yer do? I ain’t done no harm.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“For shanghaiing this boy and attempting to kill him,”
said the inventor, “you can be sentenced to a long term in
prison.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Are yer goin’ ter take me off o’ my ship?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yes; and you’ll go back a prisoner with me.”</p>

<p class='c000'>This announcement started the captain swearing furiously,
and to put an end to it Frank had him confined
aboard the Ranger, where he was no longer heard.</p>

<p class='c000'>A severe lecture was given to his crew, and they were
told to clear out of the strait with the Red Eric.</p>

<p class='c000'>This they hastened to do.</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank and his friends remained at the station several
days.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was then decided to return home.</p>

<p class='c000'>The mechanism of the flying machine was accordingly
well overhauled, and when everything was in readiness for
departure, our friends took leave of the whalers.</p>

<p class='c000'>Going aboard the Ranger, her gyroscopes were put in
motion, and she soared up into the frozen sky.</p>

<p class='c000'>A favoring breeze was encountered, the canvas was shaken
out, and under the additional speed thus imparted, she
quickly left cold Nova Zembla out of sight.</p>

<p class='c000'>She remained in a frozen sky until she reached the North
Atlantic, and finally got back in a latitude where the days
and nights were what they were accustomed to.</p>

<p class='c000'>Every one was pleased over the success of their trip, for,
in spite of the hardships they endured, they had saved Walter
Grey, secured the skeleton of the mammoth, and captured
Ben Bolt.</p>

<p class='c000'>There was an ugly prospect ahead of Dr. Vaneyke,
though, for he knew that upon his return to Readestown he
would have to answer for the murder of which he was accused.</p>

<p class='c000'>Being entirely innocent, though, he did not shrink from
it, for he felt sure of being able to vindicate himself of the
crime which had driven them adrift in the frozen sky.</p>

<p class='c000'>The flying machine finally crossed the Atlantic.</p>

<p class='c000'>She finally reached the suburbs of Boston and landed in
private ground in the dead of night, so that no one but the
owner knew of her being there, and he had no objections.</p>

<p class='c000'>The bones of the mammoth were here unshipped, and
having been packed in a number of cases were sent to Washington.</p>

<p class='c000'>This done, Captain Ben Bolt was placed in the hands of
the police, who already knew how he shanghaied Walter
Grey.</p>

<p class='c000'>When the additional charges were lodged against him,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>he was finally sentenced to a long term of imprisonment,
and went to join the rascally lawyer, Alfred Milburn.</p>

<p class='c000'>Having disposed of the captain, Frank next took Walter
Grey home to his mother.</p>

<p class='c000'>The meeting of the mother and son was very touching.</p>

<p class='c000'>When they got over their first transports of joy they
turned to speak to Frank, and thank the generous young
inventor for what he had done for them.</p>

<p class='c000'>But Frank was gone.</p>

<p class='c000'>He had quietly gone away.</p>

<p class='c000'>Returning to the Ranger, the inventor boarded her with
his friends, and headed her for the west.</p>

<p class='c000'>Her destination was Readestown.</p>

<p class='c000'>She made rapid headway toward the pretty little city,
Barney playing his fiddle and Pomp thumping his banjo.</p>

<p class='c000'>The weather was very stormy.</p>

<p class='c000'>When they reached Readestown the wind was blowing a
gale, and as they attempted to land in Frank’s grounds, the
storm caught the flying ice ship and drove it toward a
church steeple.</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank made a desperate effort to steer it away, but failed
to succeed, for it struck the steeple with a terrific shock.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Throw over the grapnel!” screamed Frank.</p>

<p class='c000'>“What’s the matter?” gasped Barney.</p>

<p class='c000'>“The gyroscope lever is broken!”</p>

<p class='c000'>The flying ice boat would have gone up, up, up, high in
the sky until it had been repaired had not the inventor
caused the grapnel to be thrown over.</p>

<p class='c000'>It caught in one of the windows in the steeple.</p>

<p class='c000'>Every moment the gale was slamming the boat against
the spire, threatening to demolish the Ranger.</p>

<p class='c000'>If that happened she was apt to fall to the ground and
kill her crew, and Frank realized it.</p>

<p class='c000'>It made him desperate.</p>

<p class='c000'>“We will have to abandon her!” he cried at last.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Can’ yo’ sen’ her down?” asked Pomp.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Not till the gyroscope lever is repaired. It would occupy
an hour or two to do that. In the meantime we may
get killed.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“What shall we be afther doin, sor?” questioned Barney.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Slide down the anchor rope to the steeple.”</p>

<p class='c000'>There was no alternative.</p>

<p class='c000'>They thought they could get the air ship when the storm
blew over, so Barney and Pomp tied their fiddle and banjo
to their backs and all hands hastened out on deck.</p>

<p class='c000'>Grasping the grapnel rope they slid down one after another
to the steeple and safely reached a platform there.</p>

<p class='c000'>Scarcely was this done when the wind caused the Ranger
to give a sudden plunge, and the grapnel tore itself free.</p>

<p class='c000'>The next moment the flying air ship shot up in the air
and disappeared in the dark storm cloud.</p>

<p class='c000'>A week afterward, when her batteries gave out, she fell
into the ocean thousands of miles away and was swallowed
up.</p>

<p class='c000'>Our friends were sorry enough to lose her, but glad to
save their lives, and finally descended the interior stairs
of the spire and reached the ground in safety.</p>

<p class='c000'>They returned to Frank’s house, where they were warmly
greeted by the inventor’s family.</p>

<p class='c000'>On the following day Frank went with Vaneyke to the
police station, so the doctor could surrender himself.</p>

<p class='c000'>Here, to their joy, they found that the real murderer had
been exposed, and was then in prison awaiting trial.</p>

<p class='c000'>He was the man who had accused the doctor of the crime,
two men going to the scene of the crime had witnessed his
villainy.</p>

<p class='c000'>That cleared Dr. Vaneyke, and the detective who had
made such a desperate effort to capture him was very profuse
in his apologies for what he had done to annoy him.</p>

<p class='c000'>The professor then left Readestown and went to Washington
to attend to the articulation of the mammoth’s
skeleton.</p>

<p class='c000'>As for Frank and Barney and Pomp, they were very
much chagrined over the loss of the Ranger, but finally forgot
all about her when the inventor announced his intention
to build a new contrivance with which they might
make a journey.</p>

<p class='c000'>Let us not anticipate, however.</p>

<p class='c000'>We have another tale ready for our readers about the
new marvel, which will appear next week in the Frank
Reade series, and as we will meet with the three friends
again, let us pause here.</p>

of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.</p>

<p>1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.</p>

  Literary Archive Foundation."</li>

<li>You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.</li>

<p>1.F.</p>

<p>1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.</p>

Defect you cause.  </p>

<h3>Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.</p>

<p>Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org.</p>

<h3>Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.</p>

<p>The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/donate">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.</p>

<p>While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.</p>

<p>International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.</p>

<p>Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate</p>

<h3>Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.</h3>

<p>Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.</p>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.</p>

<p>Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org</p>

<p>This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.</p>
